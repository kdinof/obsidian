## Highlights

> Unlike a fancy Italian store where you’re afraid to even place a finger on a bed to gauge the mattress’s firmness, **at IKEA you are encouraged to try everything and touch it freely for as long as you want**. What’s more, IKEA makes sure to speak to customers from all walks of life.

> In the ‘showroom’ located on the first floor, products are displayed for inspiration, often used in new and different ways (many you’d never think of!). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ikea-uses-the-endowment-effect-and-choice-archite-18dd962f39e#e9e31e88-c243-44a5-b0b6-fbf5eb8d1938)  

> **All this attention to detail is there to create the endowment effect. This effect causes us to value something we own way beyond its objective value, simply because it’s ours!** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ikea-uses-the-endowment-effect-and-choice-archite-18dd962f39e#ec569697-881b-4499-b3cb-97dc8cffa57e)  

> The **endowment effect kicks in once we own something or _even_ when we just picture owning it**. Even the idea of owning it, and picturing how we would use it (virtual ownership), is enough for us to [act](https://blog.crobox.com/article/data-driven-nudge-marketing-for-retail). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ikea-uses-the-endowment-effect-and-choice-archite-18dd962f39e#d0a3c6e8-9622-48dc-988d-3ec66973b82d)  

> It shouldn’t be new, that things which are salient capture our attention. But what are they exactly? Think of salient as: Everything that stands out, is novel, or seems relevant to us, captures our attention, and makes it more likely to affect our thinking and actions. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ikea-uses-the-endowment-effect-and-choice-archite-18dd962f39e#fe53b093-5781-4a37-b429-61e75df1c67c)  

> As a retailer you should make it easy for people to choose because evidence shows that the less time people spend deliberating, the more satisfied they are with the final decision. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ikea-uses-the-endowment-effect-and-choice-archite-18dd962f39e#0d9b2e07-d3a5-41ec-8de7-04ee2a49ff73)  

> So a customer who wants to pick a chair, and finds themselves in the chair department, knows what to look for. They expect chairs to be displayed along the walls and **grouped in a way that makes it easy to compare**. That is no accident! All IKEA’s product ranges are grouped according to color & design group.

> This color block display technique is called **a visual break.** There are two types of visual breaks both meant to draw attention and encourage exploration. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ikea-uses-the-endowment-effect-and-choice-archite-18dd962f39e#4f6f23ae-f43d-46f0-b749-b2c544d0902f)  

> IKEA could have chosen a design color, but it knows that every time you teach a customer something new (such as what color to associate with a discount) there’s friction. To eliminate this, IKEA relies on consistent visual cueing used in the industry to communicate discounts. And the mother of all discounts is red and yellow (in some countries they opt for a chequered design.
