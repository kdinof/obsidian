## Highlights

> for fresh groceries, 38% would look up information, 39%  would compare prices and 30% would search for promotions (Nielsen, 2016b) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#aa12dec4-8ed0-4811-8d79-ca01df4d8df7)  

> Throughout the process of decision making for online shopping, consumer behaviours are  determined by various factors. The situational factors, characteristics of products as well as the experience of  previous shopping are the basic motivations for people to shop online. Moreover, presently, consumers’ decision  making may also be influenced by the role of DSSs including decision support technologies and interactive  decision aids, which tend to help consumers by analysing and summarising the large amount of information and  increase the level of convenience and satisfaction.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#54b4ed96-0720-4394-a71d-39fd195c5f28)  

> Within the large product range, there are some unique product-categories are provided to ASOS’ shoppers. For  example, the online retailer offers a category called the Green Room - an area dedicated to brands with social  and ethical ethos [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#60967f0c-23b6-424d-89ee-b1f26cf03b43)  

> People are used to changing their approaches of making decisions according to different environment and  situations (Payne, 1982), and always try to reduce the effort related to cognition of decision making (Shugan,  1980) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#7fe79fa3-543d-4389-9443-04c8bd8947eb)  

> The differences between the processes of online and traditional shopping might be the main driving forces that  affect the sales volume of a retailer. Danaher & Davis (2003) stated that the online shopping allowed the  customer to gain information of the products easily, and the buyers can also buy the previous product they  bought last time by using a special online shopping list with saving engine [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#cc7f371e-994a-4517-9c44-11fb27c92427)  

> As a result, online retailers should  reduce product complexity, and one of the ways is to reduce the attributes used to describe a category [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#9d255d09-97b5-4b55-a0ac-c1ca89a85990)  

> Consumers enjoy trying and fitting experience in a traditional shop, and they also want to  have the same experience while online shopping [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#80d12f09-bf6d-4497-b63c-b53ec7911b5d)  

> the output stage of the decision making for online shopping includes two related post-decision actions:  the purchase behaviour and post-purchase evaluation [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#a86828b0-b65b-4430-9c62-6acb8e5932ee)  

> As the  amount of attributes is narrowed down, consumers could find the ‘best’ option easier and more quickly [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#48469c60-4ed5-4ba7-a2c3-f1aa4bc9ad83)  

> Decision-making process, which refers to brand choice and price sensitivity are quite different during traditional  shopping and online purchase. To a large extent, the differences rely on consumer’s information search process  and purchase environment. In addition, online consumers are more conservative than those with the traditional  method in the mall [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#89df6d01-2c40-4334-9cd2-e572b41cfb9a)  

> For example, the well-known brand gains more popularity on websites (Danaher & Davis,  2003), which means e-consumers are afraid of trying new products without feeling and touching them in stores.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#500e4f3e-d4e4-457e-8db9-52852af2139f)  

> Decision support technologies commonly include clustering, classification and prediction (Saranya et al., 2014).  Clustering is a popular approach to partition a set of objects into clusters according to some defined criteria  (Anderberg, 1973; Everitt & Hothorn, 1980; Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990). K-means algorithm is widely used  in online shopping web sites for its efficiency in clustering large data sets (Huang, 1998). E-consumers and  marketers can find the current trends in purchasing by using this decision support technology.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#b9d16f68-be8d-44a7-9aa1-6ade564a763e)  

> Options are good, however when loaded with alternatives,  consumers may be trapped in a ‘mixed choice task’ situation (Lynch & Weigold, 1988). Facing such a complex  decision environment, people adapt some decision making strategies to narrow down alternatives and make the  choice. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#3c5b87c1-a7c0-4e30-a4b6-a2dafb847fc8)  

> Decision-making  process, which refers to brand choice and price sensitivity, is unique in online purchase [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#7804a57b-5be8-453a-b5b2-9ba3952dc2b6)  

> Well-known brand with detailed description and lower price will  attract more consumers online, and e-consumers turn out to be more conservative and sensitive with products [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#558d08a1-24da-42f5-b641-660b50e5eeab)  

> Several motivation  factors, such as situational factors, characteristics of products as well as the experience of previous e-shopping  can influence consumers’ attitudes to shop online. Moreover, available decision support systems can help people  to make wise decisions among overwhelming information [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#7d5a2320-f68b-4a4c-9f62-78cf3d888a7b)  

> Andersone &  Gaile-Sarkane (2009) mentioned that online shopping, comparing to traditional purchase, was more money  saving. While e-retailers get high levels of income, the profits are lowered down by untenable pricing, for 28%  of e-consumers use a strategy of choosing the lowest price retailer (Mintel, 2015). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#91573a13-d636-49ed-a71c-2e764a82676e)  

> Most  consumers find the approachability and convenience from e-shopping because they can shop with comfortable  feeling in their familiar environment (Monsuwé et al., 2004). Moreover, it also saves their time and effort to  release from time pressure [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#2ca8cfbe-1bcc-46c7-8dc2-4c6eae85119e)  

> ID3 algorithm as a simple decision tree learning algorithm can help  to classify products in a DSS (Peng, Chen, & Zhou, 2009) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#119f6197-d6fc-4a27-9adb-aa840318b0de)  

> Chang (2011) revealed that when the goods were  sorted into more subcategories, consumers would experience greater ease of navigation and more shopping  pleasure [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#84221379-f2cf-4447-a327-6cb6e8c98134)  

> An important perceived disadvantage of online shopping comparing to traditional shopping is the delivery time.  During the decision-making process of online shopping, e-consumers must take the delivery time into  consideration [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#f90374b5-2153-4185-ab3d-65f113c02b3c)  

> People may also think highly about e-shopping when they have  special items needed, want to find attractive alternatives or overcome geographical distance. For example, when  people encounter with a situation of ‘lack of mobility’, they can switch to e-shopping for lack of time for a  traditional shopping [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#6d21fbdd-b9ea-4b56-95cf-5667955a7761)  

> Prediction is a mechanism to predict the following steps or events from the existing databases (Saranya et al.,  2014). Agrawal (1993) present an efficient algorithm to generate all significant association rules among a large  database of customer transactions and applied this algorithm to sales data obtained from a retailer.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#33488991-23e1-43a4-a90a-22858695dd21)  

> Meantime, consumers can hardly physically touch and feel, and even try the  products as they usually do in a traditional store. Such problems lead to risk and uncertainty of online shopping  (Monsuwé et al., 2004). As a result, trust issue has become one of the most common concerns over e-commerce  (Lee & Turban, 2001) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#5234e419-b3a0-4331-99cb-07602ec29e36)  

> Therefore,  available interactive decision aids can help people to make wise decisions.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#efd74a7c-08cb-4ce8-a8f8-7ec276825954)  

> The first one  is a recommendation agent (RA) which is a tool for getting advice about alternatives. For example, the column in  Amazon “Customers who bought the items in your Shopping Basket also bought” gives the consumers an advice  about the similar ones they may be interested in [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#909d1824-62cb-481a-aa23-9f158c6eb6ae)  

> The second tool is a comparison matrix (CM) which can  organise products by prices, scores and so on. This tool can help consumers make quick and wise decisions to a  large extent [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#fa340442-dc74-482f-93d4-b4367998443e)  

> The  website marketing efforts use direct external factors such as TV commercials, promotions, or website  advertisements in order to inform the consumers the characteristics of the products as well as where to buy them.  Additionally, the use of the Internet as a source of information increases the likelihood that the Internet is also  used as a shopping channel [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#1ef1387c-c1c7-4d6d-9f81-7eca886a6702)  

> Perceived trust exerts a stronger influence on purchase decisions of potential  customers as compared to that of repeat customers [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#af22a7cf-b8cf-4c1e-9c5c-f1a1fab443d3)  

> The good perception of information, payment form, delivery, or enjoyment, which  may result in satisfaction, will lead to the positive association and repeat purchasing in the future (Monsuwé et  al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2007) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#cfc056b3-6c0d-4e43-8ba7-b46840852eb7)  

> consumers may buy online because of friends  or family. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#d9e119af-5dab-4db6-9fa6-337b58c72bcb)  

> Even though e-commerce is expanding rapidly (Aguilar-Savén,  2004), our understanding of the behaviour of e-consumer is limited (Karimi, Papamichail, & Holland, 2015).  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#bbfe9470-0b76-45d9-ae04-c6b8ae074f55)  

> Decision-making during online shopping is different from that in other purchasing methods, such as street  shopping. Marketers need to identify the determinants of consumers’ online shopping process. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#8a88eddf-d131-4a68-9e5c-14903f8db8d1)  

> At the introduction stage of the life cycle, costs of the newly introduced products are high while the revenues of  them are low. However, during the growth period, revenues start to outstrip costs and contribute to the  company’s profitability. But the life cycle in fashion can be a matter of days. The contribution of fast introducing  and promoting online seem to be in key importance [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#c5faaa09-8f35-4ea2-a3c7-de7b16de02d0)  

> Many psychological factors have  impacts on how the external inputs from the input stage would affect customers’ recognition of product they  need, pre-purchase information search as well as the choices evaluation [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#c9ef57d0-cd43-4984-a3c8-180c10ca4f01)  

> Smith (2003)  gave a framework of online decision-making process. Zhou, Dai, & Zhang (2007) stated various ways of  consumer’s decision and motivation, while Monsuwé, Dellaert, & Ruyter (2004) argued that the motivation  factors are also influenced by external factors. Saranya, Anjana, & Thomas (2014) introduced and analysed  decision support systems (DSSs) as computer based information systems which can support decision making by  analysing data and provide interactive information. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#d3e05341-477d-411b-bb1b-d67f057d0a43)  

> consumers are more brand and size loyal in online shopping than in traditional channel (Chu, Arce-Urriza,  Cebollada-Calvo, & Chintagunta, 2010). The building of brand loyalty is much more important for an online  retailor.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#407b6f5a-a8f3-4bdb-81dd-7cad458a6554)  

> Due to amount of products alternatives, the recommendation agent is essential for customers to list their  preferential options. It restricts products which customers do not consider as their choices and makes them select  the products effectively as well [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-6-bf-4-a-334-fa-2-d-11-ee-87-eb-d-3000-aaf-0366-59367-212011-1-18edb6d2be3#dc49f4c8-deb3-41a4-8eaa-6bd41ee03ba9)
