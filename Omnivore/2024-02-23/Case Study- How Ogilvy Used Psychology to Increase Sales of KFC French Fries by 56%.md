## Highlights

> This is no accident but the result of a clever french fry coup conducted by a team of behavioral scientists and creatives. By the end of the promotion, the **total amount of sales of “one-dollar Aussie chips” in South Australia will have risen by 56%**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#40e85054-9d7d-4eb7-a21f-ac2735232bb9)  

> “But we couldn’t change the product or the price, **we could only change how people saw it**. In order to bring the right ingredients into the mix, we looked at the literature and found 18 different principles from psychology most relevant to the **perception of value** within fast-moving consumer goods [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#3cca9990-31d0-4366-9a32-6bae4b653bea)  

> These principles involve more broadly-known concepts like **_scarcity_**— if something becomes scarce, we fear we might miss out on it and so we value it more; **_loss aversion_** — we’re twice as motivated to avoid a loss as we are to receive a gain; and **_social norming_** — if a lot of people are doing something, others see that it must be valuable, so they follow suit. (Remember your mom asking you, “If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#0123e88b-19c4-402d-946c-0490d702e812)  

> But the team also explored more obscure behavioral principles and biases. For instance, a concept called **_value payoff_**— if something feels too good to be true, we start thinking: “Okay, what’s the catch?” and tend to look for the negatives. As Sam cheekily points out: “**For instance, people might wonder, are those old potatoes?**” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#38acd853-148e-4a36-8a7d-9463b1744152)  

> The first core message was designed to trigger loss aversion. It contained a timely constraint, which was vague enough to create uncertainty and encourage people to engage with the offer by generating a FOMO response.
> 
> No bells and whistles, it simply said: “**$1.00 french fries won’t be around forever.**”
> 
> Notice that it didn’t specify when the deal would end. If it said the deal would be valid for the next 3 months, people might still feel like they had enough time, but this way they were not so sure. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#727f9513-11ab-4fb0-b870-c1b1a18610e5)  

> Recognizing a limitation in the offer to reinforce the value was another interesting frame that the Ogilvy team tested out. This was achieved by leading in with the hook in order to reinforce the value with the message reading: “**$1.00 french fries – pickup only**.”
> 
> “What’s really interesting about that particular frame is that KFC in Australia doesn’t do delivery anyway. And so we were basically just shining light on a fact, to reinforce the value of $1.00 french fries,” Sam reveals with a little twinkle in his eye.

> “By arming someone with an anchor, we can shape the perceived quantity that an individual should purchase [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#bc393fbe-2fa2-4486-a9a6-17575450669f)  

> When [Snickers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3151931?seq=1) bars offered a promotion that read: “Buy 18 bars for your freezer” instead of just saying buy some for your freezer, the **average number of bars sold went from 1.4 bars to 2.6**.
> 
> Similarly, [Campbell’s soups](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3151931?seq=1) started selling more when there was a limit of 12 cans per person. It went up from selling 3.3 cans on average (before the limit), to 7 cans after the limit had been introduced. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#d9924f60-d8d7-4aeb-a52c-8c3c43dab8df)  

> The idea – to bring a quantity anchor front and center – came naturally since one of the campaign disclaimers was “**maximum four per customer**.” “So rather than using the quantity disclaimer in the copy at the bottom of our ads, we turned it into our main headline,” Sam reveals. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#adf67dd9-55b4-46aa-a825-b943e202dc53)  

> The final message tapped into the power of herd behavior, also known as [social proof](https://insidebe.com/articles/things-to-learn-from-pokemon-go/) (for all those Cialdini fans out there). 
> 
> It read: “**Everyone’s enjoying our french fries for $1, why not you?**”, providing an example to follow a specific action many others find irresistible. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#8f679c69-1ad7-4fd1-bb33-54e1c04ffaa1)  

> This illustrates an important point. Behavioral science isn’t a silver bullet. But by testing and learning, we can understand what strategies are most effective and we can replicate and scale that accordingly. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-ogilvy-used-psychology-to-increase-sales-of-kfc-f-18dd5ae1b1e#23fc79ff-9ab3-4e64-9957-a0da2f40b3c1)  

> * **Treat every new campaign as market research to inform you of your future decisions.** There’s no need to go all-in on the first try. Identify a proxy to assess message potency and start by testing out universal principles to see what performs better.
> * **Don’t be afraid to use theory as a starting point**. Theoretical concepts may feel heavy, so think of ways to use these principles as a basis for generating questions that will allow you to come up with mini propositions and ultimately to final messaging. Some concepts will translate more easily and some won’t, and that’s OK.
> * **Be ready to embrace seemingly illogical solutions.** For example, if you introduce a little hindrance or limit people’s choice by scarcity or anchoring just like KFC, you can drive action you’d like to see more of.
