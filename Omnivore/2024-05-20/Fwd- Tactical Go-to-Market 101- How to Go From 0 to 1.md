## Highlights

> ### **Bringing it all together**
> 
> * _If you're selling to consumers or prosumers_, lean into PLG, community, and partnerships early on. Layer in paid marketing as you find product-market fit and have budget to scale.
> * _If you're selling to SMBs_, blend inbound and outbound motions to build awareness and relationships. Paid digital can accelerate pipeline generation as you dial in your ICP.
> * _If you're selling to enterprises_, focus on targeted ABM and partner ecosystems. Inbound is great for air cover, but outbound is crucial for landing large accounts.
> * _If you have a complex or technical product_, make sure you have developer docs, free tooling, and community support from day one. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-tactical-go-to-market-101-how-to-go-from-0-to-1-18f943b96d4#8120ff68-f030-42a8-bea3-fde6979e67f4)

> * How did you purchase this category of software last time?
> * And what did you found looking there?
> * Did you look elsewhere?

> A big mistake people make with GTM channels is to put 30 days into a test with an agency, and conclude that channel isn’t worth it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-tactical-go-to-market-101-how-to-go-from-0-to-1-18f943b96d4#743a62da-78be-4056-82bf-9ff3b2d10380)
