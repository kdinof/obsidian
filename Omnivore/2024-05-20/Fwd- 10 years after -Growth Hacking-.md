## Highlights

> In 2024, things have narrowed quite a bit. Scarcity has replaced abundance, as we are on the [closing years of the mobile S-curve](https://substack.com/redirect/b0d800bf-e795-4595-808c-f64e278461fd?j=eyJ1IjoiNTN1anIifQ.%5Fcs15omuJPuZlh2nH-dqoTSDkppGwYIZeEPu4uVLTyI). The novelty drive has decayed, and it’s now very low on mobile — people aren’t interested to try new apps, as their homescreens (and brains) are full of apps developed over the past decade.

> The consumer novelty drive is important because it causes all sorts of goodness:
> 
> * More organic growth / word of mouth and signup conversion
> * … but more one-and-done usage, comparison shopping, and higher churn [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-10-years-after-growth-hacking-18f954ac728#efbc9bed-79de-4679-9fb2-ad22362a5a7e)  

> **There are many limitations to growth hacking**  
> The old hands who used growth hacking techniques on many products across many growth channels eventually found major limitations:
> 
> * For startups, it turns out you can’t A/B test your way to product/market fit. You don’t have enough users to generate statistically significant data, and the changes you need to make in your product are often big, not small. Make big, bold moves, not little landing page changes — the latter won’t help you enough
> * While growth teams often delivery a steady stream of +5% lifts across a lifecycle, they can’t fight against the larger waves of seasonality, poor retention, S-curve dynamics, nor are they sometimes as impactful as doing dumb/simple things like doubling the customer acquisition budget or dropping the price. And sometimes you just need a big product swing to reset things
> * Growth projects work best when there’s a lot of data to quickly hit statistical significance, the metrics can be evaluated daily or weekly, and it affects an obvious thing like Revenue or Signups. This means they are best for top-of-funnel initiatives at large/scaled products, not startups and not longer-term factors like retention — thus limiting their use case
> * Aggressive growth projects often lead to UX cruft, slowly degrading long-term user engagement and retention. Yes, you can move short-term metrics by throwing a blocking modal that up-sells a subscription (yes newspaper websites, I’m talking about you!) but how long before that alienates long-term users?
> * In larger companies, the product teams often end up fighting with growth teams as they are often implemented as two separate squads of PMs/engineers/designers who overlap. The growth teams often get the reputation as hacky/bad who don’t stretch beyond technically simple projects [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-10-years-after-growth-hacking-18f954ac728#559428c5-dd47-4a9c-83e4-3dbb8691b33b)  

> When many teams have the same ideas and employ the same tactics on the same channels, they burn out the collective customer psyche. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-10-years-after-growth-hacking-18f954ac728#900ad586-24f2-4f54-b38d-39e4f9bc835a)  

> Generative AI will give us an incredible amount of leverage to build new apps simply by prompting and no code tooling. Platforms are even bigger than before, and new memes/apps/conversations spread instantly across billions of people. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-10-years-after-growth-hacking-18f954ac728#66319f01-2c42-4859-b573-288e0c3f3246)  

> In other words, there is a reinvention of growth channels, but today’s most effective tactics are very different than what existed before. While we are unlikely to install new apps, we are willing to follow new creators, or share videos/links/photos. We spend a ton of time on social media, within video apps, and comms/collab products in the workplace. It’s partly why creators, short-form video, and shareable memes have become such important growth drivers for new startups today, even though sometimes the spikes are short and ephemeral. And within the workplace, why PLG and bottoms-up growth are often fueled as much from co-workers sharing content as much as observing content posted by AI influencers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-10-years-after-growth-hacking-18f954ac728#30363887-d4a1-4161-b9b3-372832e0cc1a)  

> Instead of highly optimized flows that have been endlessly A/B tested, startups can simply show a first gen AI tool for making okay-but-not-great videos, and everyone will endlessly talk about it. One day this novelty will settle down, but until then, game on! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-10-years-after-growth-hacking-18f954ac728#46cf63a8-fb28-4bd6-9af4-35ed588f2a75)  

> I think we’ll also see, with smarter AI-powered conversations, that marketing will look more like sales over time. Rather than 1:many broadcast, we will have many 1:1 agents selling people over chat/phone/video and providing a truly personalized pitch. We only have marketing because 1:1 sales for everything is too expensive. But with AI allowing people to convert $ to labor, we will see unique combinations of mass 1:1 sales with brand efforts to give your virtual salesforce air cover. And along with sales, mass personalized landing pages, product experiences, and so on. Everything will be white glove and concierge, rather than mass-produced.
