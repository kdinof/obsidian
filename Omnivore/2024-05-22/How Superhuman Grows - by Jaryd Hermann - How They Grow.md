## Highlights

> But, some people now want more than just _functionality_. There is so much noise around us, that people want to find ways to optimize their productivity and get the most out of their limited time. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#70e3ba74-6cef-4293-98ef-84c8eee6b12a)  

> So, we’re seeing a wave of **new** **productivity tools that focus on creating user experiences that give time back to their users.** These Microsoft and Google challengers aim to help people complete their tasks faster while having a delightful experience. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#0fe29bc4-fd45-43aa-bf77-7ffc7f2cf37d)  

> We’re seeing an evolution from _Get things done,_ to _**Get things done faster and with style.**_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#a3320945-8c35-4fbf-b628-f262d44a7d36)  

> But while everyone else is focused on growth-at-all-costs and building a 100% tech-driven, human-free experience to support that — Superhuman uses scarcity to choose their growth rate, pre-qualify their leads with high-touch onboarding , and build even more organic interest. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#c6a46e0d-d320-4f23-aeb7-dc3646cf6dfe)  

> Superhuman has brought a premium product to an existing market where the norm is _free email -_ building a \~$2bn business. And they’ve done that by making **a specialized tool for a very specific group of people — founders, managers, and executives —** and knowing how to market to them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#96eaca40-db33-4823-b0b6-476b1f16d5bd)  

> To throw you right into the middle of the story — Rahul became _obsessed_ with a dead simple formula that he could not get out of his head.
> 
> * We [spend about 3 hours a day on email](https://hbr.org/2019/01/how-to-spend-way-less-time-on-email-every-day)
> * And there are [\~1 billion knowledge workers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/12/10/the-year-of-the-knowledge-worker/?sh=312e48677fbb)
> * _That’s 3 billion hours a day on email_
> 
> I’m not sure if Rahul did this part, but here’s a cool analogy to show the scale of that: **that’s about 350,000 years in email a day, or the same amount of time since the beginning of homo sapiens.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#3ccff7cc-b391-4e2d-83c0-e00b9894f798)  

> **framework we can use to come up with our own startup ideas.**
> 
> 1. **Market first**: Start with a market or space that interests you, ideally one you’re familiar with. Then look for a specific problem. If you want to raise money — make sure it’s a big market, or a small one that’s growing fast.
> 2. **Find an experience ripe for improvement:** Look for areas where you think there should be a better experience than the status quo, and iterate from there.
> 3. **Problem first**: Start with a problem you’ve experienced firsthand or have a unique insight into, and then go find out if enough other people have the same problem. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#d0d24c1c-8d83-4aec-841b-f2c290bc9a00)  

> When you have an idea — you have a hypothesis.
> 
> It doesn’t matter how big or small the idea is, or whether you even consciously think about hypotheses — **there’s** _**always**_ **a reason you believe it will work.**
> 
> Before you go outside in shorts — check the weather.
> 
> Before you eat old leftovers — sniff it.
> 
> _**Before**_ **you start a company — find out if it’s a good idea.** And just like you don’t want to wait too long to figure out if that 3-days-old Chinese food was bad — you don’t want to end up building something nobody wants and wasting potentially years of your life. No pressure.
> 
> **You can’t (successfully) grow a bad idea.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#588e0052-9c24-4948-9b21-cdf9930539d1)  

> **In the first year of Superhuman, as we were primarily building, we threw up a landing page**. It was a terrible landing page, a basic Squarespace thing, that took us all of 2 hours to put together. All you could do on this page was throw in your email address. And when you threw in your email address, you got an automatic email from me, with two questions:
> 
> _1\. What do you use for email today?_
> 
> _2\. What were your pet peeves about it?_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#fcea4ad8-61a3-435e-bde0-0e3ab582d20c)  

> Part of the validation came from people responding to their page’s value statement (enough for many founders). But, **if they saw themes in the answers** — they’d know they were right, _and_ they’d know what the biggest problems to focus on were. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#1ddc7e77-3a71-45c0-946c-a88114d9fd8b)  

> **First, know who your target audience is.** Then, try one of the [7 other strategies that Lenny Rachitsky found account for every consumer apps early growth](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-the-biggest-consumer-apps-got):
> 
> * **Go to your users,** _**offline**_**.** Find out where your users are hanging out in real life and meet them there. [Snapchat went to malls](https://www.amazon.com/How-Turn-Down-Billion-Dollars/dp/1250108616), [Tinder went around college campuses.](https://benchhacks.com/growthstudies/tinder-growth-hacks.htm)
> * **Go to your users,** _**online**_**.** Find the groups and forums where people are talking and meet them there. [Dropbox went to Hackernews](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/9pgudv/how%5Fdropbox%5Fgot%5Ftheir%5Ffirst%5Fusers/), [TikTok went to the App Store.](https://news.greylock.com/productsf-2016-b753fa9159b8)
> * **Invite your friends.** Ask your friends if they’re from your target audience to join. Examples of founders who went the friend route are [Slack](https://review.firstround.com/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy), [LinkedIn](https://www.quora.com/LinkedIn-product-1/How-did-LinkedIn-product-get-its-initial-traction), and me and this newsletter. _Thanks for joining first [Joe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-miller-37b01b120/)!_
> * **Create FOMO.** This requires having a strong value proposition or an inherently social product. Superhuman, [Robinhood](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-app-vlad-tenev-founder-free-stock-trading-valuation-2017-7), and Clubhouse are the best examples here of companies that created FOMO with their waitlists.
> * **Use influencers.** Find out who the influencers are in your target market, and then get them to talk about your product. Good examples here are [ProductHunt](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024472/how-we-got-our-first-2000-users-doing-things-that-dont-scale) and [Twitter](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6505/The-March-Of-Twitter-Analysis-of-How-And-Where-Twitter-Spread.aspx).
> * **Get press.** Is there a unique, compelling, fresh story you could pitch to the press? This overlaps with entering the zeitgeist, but also stands alone. We know Superhuman did this, but [Slack](https://review.firstround.com/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy) and [Instagram](https://thenextweb.com/news/kevin-systrom-on-instagrams-meteoric-rise-and-when-is-it-coming-to-android-interview) used press well.
> * **Build a community.** This takes more time, but building a community early gives you a great platform to leverage later. [Producthunt started building community with a mailing list](https://www.fastcompany.com/3024472/how-we-got-our-first-2000-users-doing-things-that-dont-scale), and [Stackoverflow](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76126/how-did-stack-overflow-get-started) used their founders communities. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#d4a83a1e-d44d-4016-abf3-214ec8573945)  

> And this leads perfectly into two key elements of pricing: **(1) know who you’re selling to, and (2) know your value to them.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#b2a9f78b-f7b8-4edb-acca-73d2e2f7476f)  

> **Those two elements create your** _**positioning**_ **—** and that’s the foundation of a monetization and pricing strategy. [Once you have it — you can figure out your price point](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#d9d4292f-a129-4358-8b1b-63c71bdb6992)  

> We started with this article by Arielle Jackson: [Positioning Your Startup is Vital — Here’s How to Nail It](https://firstround.com/review/Positioning-Your-Startup-is-Vital-Heres-How-to-Do-It-Right/). Arielle advises using a formula like the following:
> 
> * For (target customer)
> * Who (statement of need or opportunity)
> * (Product name) is a (product category
> * That (statement of key benefit)
> * Unlike (competing alternative)
> * (Product name)(statement of primary differentiation).
> 
> We thought about this hard for Superhuman, and did further reading. In particular, [Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586?tag=capiche05-20), was very helpful [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#0a11de95-1c63-49e7-b7a3-78e08c4fa0a9)  

> As nice as it sounds — you can’t be everything to everyone and you need to understand who you’re targeting in order to make better decisions. **Superhuman’s go-to-market (G2M) positioning statement is very narrow**, and that allowed them to get _very_ specific not just about targeting in a saturated market, but knowing how to monetize and retain the right people. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#9208df8c-d627-448f-9f54-d116684cd7a9)  

> Madhavan covers lots of ways to develop pricing. We used one of the easiest methods, which is the the [Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van%5FWestendorp%27s%5FPrice%5FSensitivity%5FMeter). In late 2015, we asked \~100 of our earliest users these questions:
> 
> * At what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? (**Too expensive**)
> * At what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good? (**Too cheap**)
> * At what price would you consider Superhuman to be _starting_ to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? (**Expensive/High Side**)
> * At what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain—a great buy for the money? (**Cheap/Good Value**)
> 
> The price point that supports our premium position is the third one: "when does it feel expensive, but you'd still buy it anyway?" (One can imagine that Tesla did this with the Model S.) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#85efe040-e7d6-4c09-a5ec-ab28f970ab22)  

> Once we picked our price, we had to do a quick gut check on market size. For example: how can we grow into a $1bn valuation? Let's assume that at that point, our valuation is 10x our run rate, so our ARR is $100M. That would be \~300k subscribers at $30 per month — and that is conservatively assuming no other ways to increase ARPU (e.g. new products, or going upmarket). We asked ourselves: do we think we can get to hundreds of thousands of subscribers? We answered yes, and went ahead with the price! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#b512627a-8701-45de-af14-088ed90aa699)  

> Their onboarding has 5 goals:
> 
> 1. **Gradually build a user-base of highly qualified people.** This is simply quality of quantity. They want people who _need_ Superhuman — people who will love it and stick around.
> 2. **Learn about their customers.** Each onboarding call doubles-up as a user interview, this keeps them constantly in the loop with what people think and need, and how they work with existing alternatives.
> 3. **Ensure people get the full value ASAP and become power users.** If someone from the team is showing you around the product and getting you to do stuff in front of them — you’re going to get how things work. This cuts down the learning curve, and leads to better activation and higher retention.
> 4. **Build brand loyalty and increase retention.** They spent 30 minutes talking to me 1:1 — I felt taken care of and valued. That made me more connected to Superhuman. I have no doubt others feel the same.
> 5. **Drive virality.** I heard about Superhuman after my CMO told me about their onboarding because it’s a unique product experience worth talking about. And here I am… [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#a5436f03-6818-4dc5-943d-7c3ea4a50328)  

> Yes, personalized onboarding adds friction to growing your customer base — but it brings much higher activation and retention rates. And if done right, like Superhuman, has other growth benefits:
> 
> * **It creates delight.** Imagine joining a product and having the CEO take an hour to talk to you. We’re so used to automated onboarding checklists and generic emails, that having a real person take time to connect and help you (_not sell to you_) is a surprise. And when you’re pleasantly surprised — you tell people.
> * **Product differentiator.** Obviously Gmail and Outlook aren’t doing this, but also, no other B2C startups onboard the way Superhuman does. Doing something different in your space helps with your unique positioning.
> * **Drives word-or-mouth.** The onboarding story and the personal involvement of Rahul were the basis for viral growth. In the first weeks and months, the surprise effect got people talking on social media. This quickly turned into a viral loop, driven by positive user posts and accelerated by engagement from the media and from thought leaders. Whether you think this adds too much friction or not — the result has been a huge waiting list because they only give access to the tool after onboarding, adding another limitation that created even more demand.
> * **Gets press talking.** Superhuman got early attention because of a unique experience, not because of a pitch email sent to TechCrunch. And getting press and thought leaders in your space talking is a great way to throw fuel on a viral growth loop. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#77fe519a-a9b1-4640-a526-89ebeddc1663)  

> In 2017, I was intensely trying to find product/market fit. I searched high and low; I spoke with all the experts; I read everything I could find. This included classics such as thought pieces from [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html) ("make something people want"), [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth) ("users spontaneously tell others to use your product"), and of course [Marc Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide%5Fto%5Fstartups%5Fpart4.html) ("you can almost always feel it when it is happening"). As vivid and as compelling as these definitions were, they were all still _lagging_ indicators. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#d4340a75-48dd-42c4-a695-3174fe8538ff)  

> So, they [built a 5-step system around it](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit) to measure and optimize PMF
> 
> 1. **Setup a survey** to ask your users "How would you feel if you could no longer use your X?”
> 2. **Segment your audience** to paint a picture of your high-expectation customers (HXC)
> 3. **Analyze feedback** to flip on-the-fence users into fanatics
> 4. **Use that feedback in your roadmap** to drive improvements by doubling down on what users love and addressing what holds others back
> 5. **Continue tracking** product/market fit over time as your most important metric [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#cf3c4c38-6e0c-486c-bfd2-82dbe7633988)  

> With your early marketing, you may have attracted all kinds of users — especially if you've had press and your product is free in some way. But many of those people won't be well-qualified; they don't have a real need for your product and its main benefit or use case might not be a great fit. You wouldn't have wanted these folks as users anyway. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#4f7e4a91-6b70-4a65-bd77-bcc4eb5f3572)  

> The term _high-expectation customer, or HXC,_ was coined by [Julie Supan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliesupan/) — a G2M and positioning expert who’s worked with Airbnb, Dropbox, and Thumbtack. _“The high-expectation customer, or HXC, is the most discerning person within your target demographic. It’s someone who will acknowledge—and enjoy—your product or service for its greatest benefit. They look things up. They research things. And they have ideas for new types of products or services that can help them save money, gain time, get healthier or make their team more productive,”_ says Supan. _“If your product exceeds their expectations, it can meet everyone else’s.”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#e1318280-e6cb-40ca-ab27-7c5711921bf3)  

> She has written about this at length, and it’s a fantastic read: _\[What I Learned From Developing Branding for Airbnb, Dropbox and Thumbtack\](')._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#fd3af9b0-2fdd-4324-a2f4-48ee79ccc561)  

> When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: **you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter**. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#4fccfc9c-2c84-402a-a3af-4a8b43493880)  

> Now that the segments and personas were defined, they could analyze the responses to discover two super important things: (1) **why people loved the product**, and (2) **how they could help** _**more**_ **people love the product.**
> 
> Continuing to segment only on their HXF group — they looked at the **third question on the survey: “What is the main benefit you receive from Superhuman?”**
> 
> This allowed them to find clear themes around what people valued most — which they could then use to help answer the question, _how do we convert more people into this HXC group?_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#f98be329-cbfb-4799-8beb-85d4236a158a)  

> Politely disregard those who would not be disappointed without your product. They are so far from loving you that they are essentially a lost cause. They’ll request distracting features, present ill-fitting use cases and probably be very vocal, all before they churn out and leave you with a mangled, muddled roadmap. As surprising or painful as it may seem, don’t act on their feedback — it will lead you astray on your quest for product/market fit. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#155718f2-1e24-4579-8288-8e3cf15b864c)  

> They focused heavily on this group, because the main benefit of Superhuman resonated with them, meaning something — probably something small — was holding them back from becoming _very disappointed_ and joining the other HXC’s. So they looked more closely at their answers to **the fourth question on the survey: “How can we improve Superhuman for you?”** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#052ac3cd-a028-4301-a0da-362055e33f29)  

> Superhuman has a **growth loop — where most of the new users come directly from existing users.**
> 
> More specifically, they have a **virality loop** — where demand drives more demand. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#408142b4-e9a7-41bb-92c1-e0994a922d2d)  

> **Because by creating scarcity, they get to choose their growth rate, pre-qualify their sales leads, and drum up even more organic interest.** People want nothing more than what they can’t have, and Superhuman plays on this effect by making people jump through hoops to gain access — a stark contrast to the typical, needy, _kick-the-door-down-with-marketing-emails_ sales funnel. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-howtheygrow-co-p-how-superhuman-grows-18fa07e67ec#0185c06f-329e-475d-8323-fa93e6fdb2aa)
