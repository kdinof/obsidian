## Highlights

> “If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine.”  
> — Jim Barksdale [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-why-data-driven-product-decisions-are-hard-sometimes-impossi-18fc27c5b15#5501ec8f-d7c1-4a0e-a8df-f65b3fa6a6f7)  

> **Measuring yesterday when you should be thinking about tomorrow.** Data comes from the market you have today, not who you want to have. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-why-data-driven-product-decisions-are-hard-sometimes-impossi-18fc27c5b15#b08e52c2-87d7-48b4-a08b-59a4924ce0d9)  

> **Intuition is fast, A/B tests are slow**. Related to the last point, sometimes when you become an expert about the customer, and have great intuition, you just know how to do the right thing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-why-data-driven-product-decisions-are-hard-sometimes-impossi-18fc27c5b15#229fa201-7631-4017-8d94-d7f2322c34ab)  

> **The tyranny of the majority.** When you deal with millions of datapoints of usage, you necessarily have to aggregate people together into segments. You look at averages, and compare segments. Yet sometimes these groupings are wrong — what about the VIPs? What about the high value users? If you make decisions that appeal to a broad audience, you might attract low-value international users at the expense of high-value US users — is more always better? It takes a while to unentangle which segments you actually care about, particularly if they are the minority of your users. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-why-data-driven-product-decisions-are-hard-sometimes-impossi-18fc27c5b15#cd035c0f-6d7c-483c-87d9-2bd6e3dac28b)  

> The reality is, you can’t race their race. If you are data-driven in the same way they are, have the same dominant PM culture, and make decisions as slow as them, you will lose. They have more resources, can move the ball inches forward each time, and it’s hard to win as a result.
> 
> Instead, you may have to do the opposite to compete:
> 
> * mostly intuition rather than waiting for data
> * super fast decision-making rather than incremental decisions
> * big moves rather than small ones [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-why-data-driven-product-decisions-are-hard-sometimes-impossi-18fc27c5b15#3a332d2f-518b-467a-8048-8120eb92f205)  

> I write all of this with the deep pains and scars of using data in almost every product decision I’ve been apart of over the past decades. Of course I will always use the data. Yet in my twenties as a feral young founder, I erred towards relying on data too much — a desire to be data-driven, at all costs. But I found that often took me to local maxima.
> 
> Later on, I learned to be data-informed, still having intuition but overlaying data on top. There’s a happy medium here. But I think there is also an argument — particularly for zero-to-one situations — to just be ignorant of the quantitative data, and instead, just train on intuition. Just make decisions based on your expert qualitative opinion about the market, your customers, and your competition. And only optimize based on data later on, when it’s more appropriate.
