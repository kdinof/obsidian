## Highlights

> Airbnb feature highly-rated homes that have upcoming availability and homes that have recently been booked. What’s effective about these sections is how they leverage [social proof](https://provesrc.com/), both in terms of ratings (supports logical decision making) and testimonials (supports emotional decision making) to reinforce their home recommendations.

> Their ad copy speaks to their unique points of difference and so stands out from their competitors, which one would assume would lead to significantly better performance.
> 
> When it comes to landing pages, they mostly feature local imagery to help provide a more relevant result, and it would seem they are testing short form pages against longer ones to see which converts better. Either way, the content is highly relevant to the search term and the location which certainly can’t hurt.
