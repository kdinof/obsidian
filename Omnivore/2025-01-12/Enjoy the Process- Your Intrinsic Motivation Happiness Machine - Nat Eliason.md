## Highlights

> We develop and maintain the habit of _Doing X Because Y_, and this [extrinsic motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Incentive%5Ftheories:%5Fintrinsic%5Fand%5Fextrinsic%5Fmotivation) (a term popularized in [Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1472656259&sr=8-2&keywords=drive&linkCode=ll1&tag=natsite-20&linkId=122fd6a59b1685cf7744d8b406ced910)) propels most people through life. So long as we continue to receive the Y, we continue to do the X.

> While _Do X So that Y_ got us started, eventually, the excitement and reward from Y fade and we start to enjoy X less and less along with it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/enjoy-the-process-your-intrinsic-motivation-happiness-machine-na-1945a8ee11c#7c7beade-3689-4df8-87bc-7e8f11ed485c)  

> I’m not alone in this. The concept of the “[Hedonic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic%5Ftreadmill)” goes back as far as Stoicism and early Virtue ethicists (e.g. Aristotle), who espoused developing an internal, personally grounded happiness not tied to the acquisition or possession of anything external to you.

> When Seneca says that _“It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor,”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/enjoy-the-process-your-intrinsic-motivation-happiness-machine-na-1945a8ee11c#dafcef05-fa7e-43a7-94f7-94cb42cdd66d)  

> Philosophers were able to figure this out _a priori_, and now we have the research to back it up. We know that [lottery winners and paraplegics](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/classic-study-on-happiness-and-the-lottery.html) regress to the same rough happiness level as before, and we know that [earning a higher wage doesn’t make you any happier](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/does-money-buy-happiness-the-link-between-salary-and-employee-satisfaction/) too. It also seems that the marginal improvement to your emotional well being from increased income [plateaus around $75,000](http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/commentaries/Happiness-Benchmark.php#ixzz37eM5xPxF) (though this varies by [savable income](http://www.nateliason.com/savable-income/) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/enjoy-the-process-your-intrinsic-motivation-happiness-machine-na-1945a8ee11c#dd9f8907-6089-49be-8fde-f6b930bd7033)  

> As [Scott Adams](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591847745/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1472655089&sr=8-1&keywords=scott+adams&linkCode=ll1&tag=natsite-20&linkId=c418775b19ee6673084d2a16a81e3ff7) puts it: _“…goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary.”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/enjoy-the-process-your-intrinsic-motivation-happiness-machine-na-1945a8ee11c#3a3641f9-6014-4d0f-b442-230553590f70)  

> **This is the only way to do intense, sustained, productive work long term and not be miserable**. If you tie your happiness to the outcomes of some [deferred life plan](http://www.nateliason.com/lessons/monk-riddle-randy-komisar/), as most people do, then you spend so much of your time thinking about hitting the goal that you miss out on all the fun along the way.
