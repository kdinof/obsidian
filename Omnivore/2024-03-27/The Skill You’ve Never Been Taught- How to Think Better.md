> The Skill You’ve Never Been Taught: How to Think Better [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#56a95dbf-ca0a-455c-973e-270e629fe14d)  

Хорошая аналогия с тем, что важно описывать задачи для дизайна, чтобы понимать, что ты их действительно понимаешь. 

> Thinking better than others means you’ll have more free time and fewer problems. If you can’t think well, you’ll spend a lot of time fixing avoidable mistakes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#7968817b-d59a-44d6-a4e9-559d6fed3053)  

> If you stop thinking when most people stop thinking, you’ll come to the same conclusions most people come to. Thinking is hard, so it’s natural that most people stop as soon as possible. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#38918656-a626-4f06-b8a9-af5d46134f7c)  

> Multitasking, in short, is not only not thinking, it impairs your ability to think. _Thinking means concentrating on one thing long enough to develop an idea about it._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#27741522-c253-4040-a513-a1abcb64ba4b)  

> My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#db07cd4d-6df9-4c80-88ad-ca3979436ebd)  

> the great German novelist Thomas Mann said that a writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people. The best writers write much more slowly than everyone else, and the better they are, the slower they write. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#78ef9dac-1689-4647-84ce-680e3f64e62b)  

> The best way to improve your thinking ability is to spend time thinking. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#e369c46a-c079-4312-8e6e-6c1cf4cf7202)  

> If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#4ab5b1d9-8fc8-47fe-84a1-eb9a0098a4cc)  

> While we naturally understand that writing is a good way to share ideas with others, we under-appreciate just how much good writing helps us think about an idea ourselves. Writing is not only a means of communication, it enables us to practice reasoning. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#34fc2087-dd79-4f25-bc33-e9384ebde53e)  

> Writing forces you to slow down, focus, and think deeply. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#62642a5b-047e-48f6-a360-1faed08113ad)  

> Writing requires sticking with something a little longer and developing a deeper understanding. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#94e8abfe-e4cf-47fc-922e-d566284c9923)  

> Compression requires both thinking and clarity, which is one reason writing is an important aid to thinking. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#22e36054-d27c-49b3-873f-daff54bcab7f)  

> Good writing gives poor thinking nowhere to hide. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#77d9da42-81e8-4e86-8461-76b57b12ba26)  

> Writing forces you to test your thinking. Strangers can’t know your thoughts, unless you put them into words. So one way to test your ideas is to let other people read them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-skill-you-ve-never-been-taught-how-to-think-better-18e7e3f0df3#ce403498-3819-4967-a2ba-d5c7654f19ec)
