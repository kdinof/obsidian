## Highlights

> An asset-light strategy or business model involves transferring capabilities, such as people, process and technology, to “better owners” in order to enable companies to transition fixed costs to a variable cost structure, enhance agility, and facilitate a shift of resources that allows a focus on core capabilities. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-asset-light-business-models-can-boost-financial-performance--18fdc39d9eb#462e4f11-01ac-4c7e-990c-d87fd33d48dd)  

> Companies typically begin their asset-light journey by identifying which assets and capabilities are core to delivering value to their customer base right now. For example, sellers may find a path to greater operational agility by transitioning their manufacturing operations to a contract manufacturer rather than carving out an entire business unit and disposing of a valuable brand.

> Overall, companies should begin by asking several key questions including:  
> 
> * Is your company performing at its full potential — on growth, margin, return on invested capital (ROIC) and total shareholder returns metrics vs. peers? Is there an opportunity to perform even better?
> * Do you have businesses or capabilities that need to be retained or non-core assets that may have a better owner in the marketplace?
> * Can you create a greater focus in your organization by retaining your core capabilities only?
> * Is your business model adequate for the products and services you sell in various markets?
> * Have you undertaken any significant business model transformations (e.g., third-party partnerships, JVs) in the last two to three years? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-asset-light-business-models-can-boost-financial-performance--18fdc39d9eb#a16fda61-9331-43a5-b720-e881bb71c361)  

> Capability-level analysis for the chosen product category can help determine the right focus areas, what is possible for that capability set and the right partnership model (e.g., JV, spin-off, partnership, sale-leaseback). Capabilities are assessed in terms of the relative strategic value delivered to the customer and the company. We have observed four primary dispositions:
> 
> 1. Core capabilities (top right of the chart below) – These are critical capabilities that are usually ripe for growth and innovation. In other words, if your company doesn’t have these in-house today, executives may consider proactively looking for players to help fast-track innovation.
> 2. Non-core capabilities (bottom left) – In this quadrant, it often advantageous to actively package assets and capabilities and look for a partner that can operate these more efficiently and allow the company to focus on other “core” areas.
> 3. High value corporate capabilities (bottom right) – These are of high strategic value to the company, but the customer doesn’t place an equal degree of value on them. With these capabilities, traditional cost and capital optimization efforts generally deliver value. However, it is important to keep these capabilities on the radar for potential future deals.
> 4. High value customer capabilities (top left) – These capabilities are of high strategic value to customers. If they’re not available in-house, the partnership should be structured such that the company has a significant influence to drive high quality and service levels.
