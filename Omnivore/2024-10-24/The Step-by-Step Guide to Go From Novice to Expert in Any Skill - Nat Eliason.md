## Highlights

> **The defining element of the novice is a reliance on recipes**. Novices need clear instructions on how to do something in order to do it. They don’t have an intuitive understanding of the skill, so they need someone else’s recipes to follow in order to complete any task within the skill. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#da765580-8d1d-4400-8bd6-b55ed74ba7eb)  

> Novices have no context for why they’re doing anything. You can tell them to add more sugar or salt to a recipe, but they don’t know what that is going to do or why that’s the right decision in the situation. You can tell them to move their bishop into enemy territory, but they won’t know why that’s a good idea. You can tell them to use shorter headlines to rank higher in Google, but… you get the idea. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#fc785907-e26f-4646-b83c-e2063edd3ee6)  

> They want to look at everything at once. They can easily get overwhelmed by [too much information](https://www.nateliason.com/infomania/), which causes them to freak out and get exasperated and wonder how anyone can possibly be good at what they’re doing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#49cc4f6f-918c-4807-acdb-841fcea7107c)  

> Since the novice doesn’t have an intuitive sense for the skill, their decision making is analytical. They look at the data they have, plug it into the recipe, and go with whatever the recipe spits out. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#2a76a42b-b0b4-4d5b-8313-da5c2243afcc)  

> They don’t have an emotional or intuitive investment in the goal setting, deciding what to do, or the outcome. When something goes wrong they will blame the process, when something goes right they will say it’s a good process. They have no personal involvement in what’s happening. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#14e9c92f-f147-43fc-8749-16cb6f2ca03f)  

> **Your reaction to errors is to blame the recipe,** and without [a good system for troubleshooting on your own](https://www.nateliason.com/self-education/), you can get stuck. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#4ce97615-d4ea-4dc8-ab31-69631a94f33e)  

> The novice becomes an advanced beginner when they can start to troubleshoot their problems and work on their own. You’re still primarily using recipes, but you have more contextual awareness of when to use which recipes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#38bc62aa-e1af-4485-b1fb-28fa0445a5d1)  

> **The defining characteristic of the Advanced Beginner is recognizing “aspects” of a situation**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#98be1ef7-d5e0-44da-9680-632d921d8dc6)  

> You can see what’s different about one situation and [move through the layers of abstraction](https://www.nateliason.com/learning-through-abstraction/) and use that information to apply different recipes and guidelines to solve the problem. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#513271ea-1482-4946-977d-33b687b12ea7)  

> You don’t have a full “big picture” view of the skill yet, but you’re starting to develop more _context_ and are not completely lost when something goes wrong. **Instead of blaming the recipe when you hit an error, you know to look for another recipe**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#de537c6a-eadf-4350-a918-25061fd9a377)  

> Some examples might include:
> 
> Building a web app but relying heavily on Stack Overflow to figure out new things / troubleshoot.Recognizing when you’re “overextended” in chess and what to do about it.Learning to shift up in gear when “the engine sounds like it’s racing.”Reading a few different marketing guides to cobble together a strategy more relevant to your situation.Looking at a scene and being able to identify what [photographic composition styles](https://www.nateliason.com/take-good-pictures/) might be appropriate. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#a745318c-5044-47ff-85bf-c41ee518b340)  

> Advanced Beginner has a better idea of what recipes are relevant and can start to use maxims in their decision making. They can combine situational information (the sound of an engine, the road conditions) with non-situational information (the speedometer) to figure out what to do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#7309009b-f438-48ab-8f9c-cab6546060a0)  

> While the Advanced Beginner can start to understand the context of the situation and make decisions based off of it, they still aren’t sure what information is relevant and don’t know how to filter their inputs. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#25b2f1bc-803a-4d4f-8e30-75f7656641b6)  

> As you progress through the Advanced Beginner stage, you add more and more recipes and maxims to your experience with the skill that help you perform better and better. Eventually, you hit the point where it’s completely overwhelming and you have to develop rules about what recipes to apply when. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#0e1ef343-f9a0-43f5-b864-7e095dd4ffa6)  

> **The development of these rules is the key characteristic of the Competent.** You have a better sense of what is relevant and what isn’t, and you can draw on a wide collection of recipes based on those situational rules. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#a18b9342-3561-4a10-81c5-3633bfbbfcd1)  

> The second characteristic of the Competent is that since you’re picking your rules and using those rules to apply different recipes, you become emotionally involved in the outcome. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#dbe82653-0298-4be2-b232-7cccc7d14419)  

> While the Novice and Advanced Beginner are largely detached from the outcomes, the Competent can experience joy at making the right choice of recipes and remorse at choosing the wrong one. The locus of blame shifts from the recipe to yourself, since you are now involved in choosing what to do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#d0ca37d8-71e2-4141-9401-d78fc813eee4)  

> You’re starting to recognize what recipes and maxims apply in different situations and so you _choose_ which ones to apply based on the context. You can look at a situation and decide which recipes to apply, instead of trying to apply them willy-nilly or based on someone else’s recommendation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#93b7bccd-b0bc-44c3-9a7b-4e38d230667a)  

> ### The Challenge
> 
> Since you’re making decisions about what rules to apply and you’re emotionally involved in the outcomes, you can easily burn yourself out and exhaust your interest in the skill by getting things wrong. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#dc794a60-5e54-4d2d-bffb-e82ba2f87db3)  

> As you react emotionally to your decisions at the level of Competence, your positive and negative responses to decisions will reinforce the correct ones and discourage the incorrect ones and you will develop an increasingly intuitive sense of what recipes and maxims to apply to the situation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#06ad3ce8-d2aa-4d5e-8e9a-81eafbeceb73)  

> **The defining characteristic of the Proficient is an intuitive sense of what the goal should be given the situation**. While the Competent has to create or find rules for what to do in a situation, the Proficient has an intuitive sense of what the goal should be, but not necessarily exactly how to do it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#3700296c-fd41-4e7f-8c1c-8326a809fa01)  

> it.They can understand what someone is saying in a foreign language but must decide the best response. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#f029c29d-87a2-4cea-8f43-f88c3f0c9210)  

> Whereas the Competent performer _chooses_ what criteria to focus on and what recipes and maxims to use based on that, the Proficient performer _knows_ what criteria to focus on. They’re absorbed enough in the skill to be able to intuit what data are important, and what aren’t. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#f9f156ca-1c6b-4ef3-a55d-28b2a7ff0c72)  

> The second shift comes in moving from merely being involved in the outcome to being involved in the goal setting as well. Just as the Competent practitioner will have an emotional investment in a good outcome, the Proficient practitioner will have an emotional investment in a good outcome and good selection of goals. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#8309161a-155e-4a89-baba-0fb5bd825f81)  

> Since you’re intuiting what your goal is, you’re more invested in whether or not that was the right goal. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#a4856dc2-08c1-4223-9968-9c3c5f6f2796)  

> There’s only one last piece now to reach Expertise. Not just intuitively knowing and being invested in what your goal should be, but also in what you should do about it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#c6abc5ee-e02e-4c27-9021-aea90df2edb6)  

> The Expert operates entirely by intuition. He or she knows what their goal should be, what to do about it, and what should happen as a result. They’re emotionally involved and invested in the whole process, and since they’re running on intuition, they might have a hard time explaining why they do things to non-experts. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#9807ea5a-58cb-4abb-9e92-52c73f14c713)  

> The expert driver can feel they’re going too fast and knows how much to brake in response.The [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#21cecf11-05c3-4789-adfd-60b2176b8c6c)  

> decisions.The expert language learner can speak fluidly as if a native, they don’t need to think in their native language at all. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#06375d25-4b5c-4e8f-91ea-26a77f22e0c2)  

> They know what’s important and what isn’t, and can identify all the relevant pieces of the skill whether those are universal variables (car speed, piece value) or situational ones (road conditions, king position). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#6c4c1cda-a059-488b-a324-1f4a69b1d758)  

> Because the whole process is intuitive, the expert is emotionally invested in the outcomes of each part of the process. They emotionally feel the rightness or wrongness of their intuitions at the goal, action, and result stages, and can use that feedback to improve their intuitive decision making. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#7ecb6e1b-7bea-4e30-9c8b-2a58c07ea7e3)  

> Before you assume that you’re an expert, remember that you’re _probably_ an advanced beginner. Hunt points out that many programmers and other knowledge workers never advance past the Advanced Beginner stage primarily because **they never accept emotional consequences for their decisions**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#1da1fc94-35a2-43d8-b2d2-497dc2c6270f)  

What is emotional?

> What I’d recommend, again, is that even if you _think_ you’re proficient or an expert, **assume you’re an advanced beginner.** This keeps with the concept of _Shoshin_ or “[Beginner’s Mind](https://www.nateliason.com/lessons/zen-mind-beginners-mind-shunryu-suzuki/).” If you assume you’re an expert then learning stops, and it’s better to assume you’re more of a novice and that there’s more to learn than to assume you already know everything. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#70f194e4-4d06-4235-8385-29d890b152a3)  

> It’s worth saying first, though, that ultimately it all boils down to deliberate practice as described by [Anders Ericsson in Peak](https://www.nateliason.com/lessons/peak-anders-ericsson-robert-pool/). If you’re unfamiliar with the concept, most of the idea of deliberate practice can be boiled down to:
> 
> Deliberate practice requires a teacher or method of feedback that can provide practice activities designed to help a student improve his or her performance.Practice must be done near maximal effort where you’re constantly being taken out of your comfort zone. It shouldn’t be light or “fun.”The practice must be well defined with specific goals and not aimed at “overall improvement.”You must give the practice your full attention. No autopilot.You need feedback and constant little improvements, modifying efforts in response to feedback.You must be focusing on building and improving specific skills by focusing on aspects of those skills and improving them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#dc831c21-6e1b-4df1-af6a-a99b0fb52a40)  

> ### Going from Zero to Novice
> 
> At this stage **focus on collecting recipes**. You should be reading books, blogs, listening to speeches, taking classes, whatever will give you a large repertoire of recipes as fast as possible. But you can’t just read them, **you have to apply them**. Try following along with them, doing whatever is being talked about, and not just reading. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#634d5c32-7801-4bc3-a4b3-c9c724301b36)  

> If you only read or hear about the recipes but don’t do them yourself **it is impossible to move beyond novice.** The next stage requires a contextual understanding of different situations and the only way you develop that context is through practice. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#b6d3d020-5e20-413a-ba81-5a0a79a92e15)  

> To become a novice and get started in a skill, focus on collecting recipes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#2acbbd6d-b3ec-45ef-aa62-759a4bf5c35c)  

> Now that you’ve collected a large database of recipes and started applying them, you should begin to develop some contextual understanding of when to use which recipes. Start looking for more _maxims_ and applying them to your practice, and seeing if they make sense to you. Try breaking away from the clear recipes you have, trying to change things in them, and seeing what happens. Make your own versions of the recipes by piecing together different recipes and looking up help as you need it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#b1dd0202-5a8e-41b3-ac21-1aad78f3b286)  

Do —> reflect 

> **The only way you graduate from novice is by breaking away from fixed recipes**. You need to try improvising, combining recipes, and letting yourself make mistakes. More importantly, when something goes wrong, **start looking for how to solve it without blaming the recipe.** You won’t have the personal involvement yet, but you can start learning to troubleshoot by combining different sources of knowledge instead of relying on singular recipes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#d2dcb0b8-8aeb-4acf-9835-42b49f9d0f66)  

> You might get overwhelmed by decisions easily, and as a result, revert to simply following a recipe and hoping you get lucky. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#635c7d09-bb9d-4de4-9afa-dc90a9ac4dad)  

> Now you need to start trying to figure out what data and information is important and what isn’t. This can be hard to do on your own, which is why the Advanced Beginner to Competent stage is benefited greatly by a mentor who can provide rules and guidelines on what information to focus on. Without a mentor, you’ll need to find guidelines and rules online or in books to help you, or through trial and error, develop them on your own. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nateliason-com-blog-become-expert-dreyfus-192bc1a9015#a003c330-94d9-4091-9e94-4c33743ab2b6)
