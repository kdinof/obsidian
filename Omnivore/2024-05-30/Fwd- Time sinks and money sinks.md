## Highlights

> To dramatically oversimplify the internet, every product on the Internet is just one of two things:
> 
> * **Time sinks**. High engagement, sticky, with endless scrolling/tapping. These apps live on the home screen. Usually free or free-ish, so they are terrible at making money when measured on a $/hour basis.
> * **Money sinks**. Low engagement, you are there to do a job, so you just need it to work. But at the end, you might pull out your credit card or fill out a form that generates a ton of $. These apps don’t live on the home screen — sometimes you only visit because you tap on an ad [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-time-sinks-and-money-sinks-18fc727cf4b#79f83eae-5754-4c19-a996-396465e28ab2)  

> The apps that fit into the bottom category (ecommerce, real estate, finance, etc) are often highly episodic and aren’t meant to retain users well. You’re in market for a car, then you make a buying decision, and then you have no need to ever visit a car comparison website again. Thus, they typically buy users from the top category (social networks, news, etc) since the time sinks are great at retaining people. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-time-sinks-and-money-sinks-18fc727cf4b#b3201dd6-833c-4d66-97b2-a94efebca032)  

> Products that are Money Sinks shouldn’t care about many of these metrics, and instead they should be focused on profitable acquisition of customers (thus, CAC/LTV and % organic acquisiton). And the conversion funnel from landing on the product into ultimately purchasing. The average order value. And the orders per month, and response rates from marketing. And a dozen other metrics that have a lot more to do with buying behavior than retention or engagement.

> I often give feedback on metrics dashboards with all of this in mind. You should pick your product strategy, then pick the metrics that validate that your strategy is working. You should avoid making product strategy decisions based on high-level metrics like DAUs because those are the metrics that everyone else uses, and they will steer you towards generic product strategy. You need strategy, and metrics, that are tailored to your product. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-time-sinks-and-money-sinks-18fc727cf4b#22343a83-33fc-407f-909d-eb904fb4eb09)  

> **How business model affects product experience/design** 
> It’s become fashionable in recent years to focus entirely on product experience and ignore business model, when in fact they are very intertwined. I often use an example of how video games have evolved to show this relationship:
> 
> * arcade games: They were designed to eat quarters. Thus, they tended to be very difficult so that you could have relatively short gameplay sessions and turn over the clientele
> * At home consoles: You go to Best Buy and buy it once for $60\. Thus, you expect to be able to play it for dozens or hundreds of hours, and anything less is unacceptable. The games also became much easier so you could make your way through the content
> * MMOs: You pay $X/month, via subscription. The goal is to get you to stay retained month to month, so you need to never run out of content. Thus, the games need to have endless quests, endless worlds, endless content. And multiplayer experiences also mean that you make friends in the game, and never leave
> * free-to-play: Pay nothing upfront, and focus on very broad casual markets. There’s easy first levels, but they become hard later on (you get “pinched” and forced to pay). Or another variation is to build a game like Fortnite that’s free to play with all of your friends, very accessible, and then sell cosmetics as a form of fashion/interactivity with other players
> 
> You’d call all of the above “gaming” but in fact they are really many successive generations of very different products that have been influenced by their underlying business models. Based on how monetization happens, not only does the average difficulty of the games change, but so does the emphasis on multiplayer, content depth, and so on.

> The newspaper business was a classic time sink, even though it existed in the physical world — you read your paper every morning, and sections like world news, politics, and opinion drove daily engagement and stickiness. But then in the back of the paper, classifieds and ads were the mechanism where the time sink business could sell eyeballs to the money sink businesses that bought ads.

> And second there are tremendous demographic changes happening. Younger demographics play games, and aren’t watching TV. I think pretty obvious that this trend will only continue over time.
