## Highlights

> At its core, design is taking an idea and making it tangible. Building your designs is a continuation and extension of that tangibility. Ignore the question of whether designers should code and look at it as we should build our designers.

> Low-fidelity builds invoke high-fidelity questions. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-building-your-designs-18d9aefd55d#b5fb205d-222d-4b6a-9568-671712d9cecb)
