## Highlights

> First and foremost, I emphasize the importance of collecting ideas. These ideas can come from anywhere – opinions, statements of fact, interesting factoids, statistics, or even visual content such as charts and graphs. These are things from X or books or Reddit or whatever. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#73ce1963-6ad9-4045-a475-c97d37ec7d22)

> The idea of “templates” is useful too – these are commonly repeating versions of posts that you can repeat, over and over, that always generate interesting content. Here’s some examples:
> 
> * reviews of books
> * quotes from podcasts/articles
> * lessons learned from past projects
> * Q&A with a colleague/friend
> * top links about a particular topic
> * your answer about a particular topic
> * reflections on the past year/quarter
> * a factoid/statistic you found surprising [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#b924a6e1-a1c7-466b-80b1-99ffdd404e8d)  

Что для меня может стать «Шаблоном»? Пока кажется, что только UX Bites и небольшие посты про Growth

> Some thoughts:
> 
> 1\. quality focus hinders more writing and content creation  
> 2\. leads to procrastination and restricts experimenting with styles  
> 3\. taste develops faster than skills, causing disappointment  
> 4\. it’s important to accept failure as part of learning  
> 5\. start small, expand based on audience feedback  
> 6\. regular writing, experimenting with styles keeps process enjoyable [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#e353bb98-d9aa-448b-8b35-e36ef0a8c489)  

> Firstly, focusing too much on quality is a great way to procrastinate. It leads to endless editing, turning what could be a quick tweet storm into a months-long essay project. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#4e361853-19cc-44f2-abf2-002d5c86be5b)  

> it hampers your ability to experiment. When starting out, finding your voice is crucial, and it often takes time and trial and error. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#3f99c0ec-0eab-40a5-8dc0-894e88cdee26)  

> Experimentation is key, and a high-quality standard can stifle creativity and output. Initially, you might dislike your work as your taste develops faster than your skills, creating a frustrating gap between your taste and abilities.

> For example, start with a tweet, expand it into a thread if it’s well-received, and then develop it into an essay. This approach helps align your work with what your audience wants. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#e674127d-e4ff-43d8-ae2d-a9467c32c095)  

> writing should be fun and conversational. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-how-to-write-more-18d108dffc1#5b9fc52d-92ab-439a-bbcb-48e3c15e9cde)
