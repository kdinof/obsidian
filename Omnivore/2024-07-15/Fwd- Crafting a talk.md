## Highlights

> I initially was hesitant about giving talk. It wasn’t until a mentor of mine said giving a talk at a conference is a way to share an idea at scale that can be helpful and community service. That framing changed my perspective. It’s also a way to share awareness of your company brand. You might be recruiting at a tech company or run an independent studio to find new clients.
