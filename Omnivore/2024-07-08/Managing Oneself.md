## Highlights

> We have to place ourselves where we can make the greatest contribution to our organizations and communities. And we have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#b25cc85a-4369-4a8e-94b1-ec481f5a2aff)  

> Don’t try to change yourself, Drucker cautions. Instead, concentrate on improving the skills you have and accepting assignments that are tailored to your individual way of working. If you do that, you can transform yourself from an ordinary worker into an outstanding performer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#d9f44fe8-edeb-4335-8f35-373948387b8a)  

> We will have to learn to develop ourselves. We will have to place ourselves where we can make the greatest contribution. And we will have to stay mentally alert and engaged during a 50-year working life, which means knowing how and when to change the work we do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#a20380ba-2650-43f0-a302-ca85bfbd2b3f)  

> Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results.
> 
> Second, work on improving your strengths. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge—and those can usually be filled. Mathematicians are born, but everyone can learn trigonometry. 
> 
> Third, discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome it. Far too many people—especially people with great expertise in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or believe that being bright is a substitute for knowledge. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#82a2b117-3b6f-448d-88be-952b426e8be7)  

> For example, a planner may find that his beautiful plans fail because he does not follow through on them. Like so many brilliant people, he believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers should go to work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#f83030bc-a020-4212-9d12-a7bb4df9b35c)  

> Manners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a person’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#ee306920-3485-48ed-8524-70d0abcb4172)  

> Comparing your expectations with your results also indicates what not to do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#8d2988a9-ac04-4034-a08d-b3c79482f394)  

> do. We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre. In those areas a person—and especially a knowledge worker—should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from [first-rate performance](https://hbr.org/2021/10/5-things-high-performing-teams-do-differently) to excellence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most organizations—concentrate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent person into a star performer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#afe4226a-f4c4-4bbd-a7ba-7cfc2f17a0ae)  

> Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. For knowledge workers, How do I perform? may be an even more important question than What are my strengths? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/managing-oneself-1909011ee3b#324882f0-c254-4d61-b164-db58c8de9483)
