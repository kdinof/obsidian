## Highlights

> We feel a sense of **ownership and possession**. Not only do we not want to give up things that we own, but we attribute more value to them. This is called the **endowment effect** and it can play a huge part in marketing campaigns and sales. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#08d8f2ab-6d67-4f7c-a61a-cf36fe4bdcd8)  

> But what if the shop assistant used a different strategy? What if he said: “_Hey, that’s a great TV._ _What do you think you’d enjoy watching on it most?”_ Suddenly, you’d find yourself imagining what it would be like if you owned it. You could finally watch football and see every detail. You’d probably invite a few friends over, have some beers, and have a great time. You love the idea. And surprisingly, it’s then hard to let it go. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#8c77a687-b17f-4594-85f6-8f7c5624cbf9)  

> **Just the idea of possession can create the endowment effect. Make your customers imagine what it would be like to own your product** – how it will feel and what they can use it for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#c863de59-ceb3-4c75-b3a9-13343844fd77)  

> This is also partially why shop assistants in brick-and-mortar clothes shops try really hard to make you try that new dress on and look at yourself in the mirror. Customers can feel the fabric, **they can imagine themselves wearing the clothes** on several different occasions, and they even start to feel excited about it**.** Letting it go is painful.

> The endowment effect is based on one of the most powerful behavioral principles out there – **loss aversion.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#c1d5b553-a421-4d54-bced-fb62ec972107)  

> It was first described in Kahneman and Tversky’s [study](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/kahneman/files/prospect%5Ftheory.pdf) in the late 1970s. To put it simply, it says that **we hate experiencing losses approximately twice as much as we like gains.** In other words, you would be twice as sad if you lost 50€ as you would be happy if you found the same amount. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#b4f8e34d-0c7a-40ce-bdf8-16b0cb74d5ad)  

> This loss aversion paves the way for the endowment effect. **As we hate losing things, we attribute more value to them to compensate for their loss**. For example, [Carmon and Ariely famously showed](https://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersPI/Value%20Buyer%20and%20Seller.pdf) that people who won tickets for a basketball game were willing to sell them for much higher prices ($2,400 on average) than others were willing to buy them for ($175 on average). The tickets were worth so much more to them once they owned them.

> When you offer your customers a discount or any other benefits, **frame it as if it’s already theirs** and all the customer needs to do is to use or activate it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#1b3458b6-cefd-4113-8f82-acfa726b7f12)  

> If you can, **always let the customer try your product first**. Once the customers know what it’s like to use it on a daily basis, they will feel the value and won’t want to let it go.

> put the idea in their heads and make them imagine as vividly as possible what life with your product would look like. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/3-clever-ways-to-leverage-the-endowment-effect-online-inside-be-18d39e3271f#1bf6a40e-0c8b-49c5-b35e-54de07524f28)
