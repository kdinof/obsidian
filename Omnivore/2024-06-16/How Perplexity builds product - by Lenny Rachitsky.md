## Highlights

> My goal is to structure teams around minimizing “coordination headwind,” as described by [Alex Komoroske](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-komoroske-6597336/) in [this deck on seeing organizations as slime mold](https://komoroske.com/slime-mold/). The rough idea is that coordination costs (caused by uncertainty and disagreements) increase with scale, and adding managers doesn’t improve things. People’s incentives become misaligned. People tend to lie to their manager, who lies to _their_ manager. And if you want to talk to someone in another part of the org, you have to go up two levels and down two levels, asking everyone along the way.
