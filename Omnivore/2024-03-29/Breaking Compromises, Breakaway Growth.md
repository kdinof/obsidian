## Highlights

> Trade-offs typically come from fundamental differences in cost structures that are usually reflected in prices. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/breaking-compromises-breakaway-growth-18e88a95be5#b1e336f3-df17-48e3-9178-78ce823146c8)  

> Thus taxi service costs more than bus service, and a meal delivered by room service costs more than the same meal ordered in the hotel restaurant. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/breaking-compromises-breakaway-growth-18e88a95be5#4ac0ee1d-c9af-41ba-83f5-4c5bd52c39c6)

> A compromise, in contrast, is a concession demanded of consumers by all or most service or product providers. Whereas trade-offs let customers choose their preference among alternatives, compromises offer no choice. Trade-offs allow different offerings to appeal to different segments; compromises benefit no particular segment. Trade-offs are very visible; most compromises are hidden. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/breaking-compromises-breakaway-growth-18e88a95be5#d5690716-8220-4c5b-977c-8dc80408fd55)  

> Compromises occur when an industry imposes its own operating practices or constraints on customers, leaving them no choice. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/breaking-compromises-breakaway-growth-18e88a95be5#1bbebaa5-3349-47fd-9036-4d809f0d353d)  

> The most important compromises, however, are forced on customers simply because companies have lost touch with those customers’ needs. Finding and breaking those compromises can unleash new demand and create breakaway growth.

> Before Contadina’s innovation, consumers faced one trade-off and a multitude of compromises in their quest to eat pasta. The trade-off was between eating pasta at home—where someone has to make it—and eating out at a restaurant. Pasta at home is less expensive. The restaurant has more variety and means less work, but it costs more. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/breaking-compromises-breakaway-growth-18e88a95be5#e9b7d8d9-ec0c-42c0-8335-d0575d6b2cab)  

> Consumer research provides some interesting insights. Naturally, consumers like its freshness and its ease of cooking. More surprising is the fact that consumers are choosing Contadina over a meal at a restaurant. Before Contadina’s fresh pasta became available, many people said they would never eat tortellini or ravioli at home, because preparing them from scratch was just too much trouble.
