## Highlights

> What if she came, solved the problem in under two minutes, and then charged you the same: €100 EUR? What?! €100 EUR for just two minutes of work?! She can’t possibly be serious! But think about it for a second. Even if she got rid of your problem far quicker than the first scenario, you feel robbed. Do you see the difference?

Похоже на часть из лекции про формирование цены за дизайн от Chris Do. Если слесарь потратил меньше времени, значит результат меньше стоит?

> We use the time and effort of the provider as a proxy. When somebody works hard, they deserve more money. A simple rule of thumb. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#f5543af7-f18f-4bc0-97b1-f636aace2fba)  

Какие прокси могут быть у бизнеса одежды, чтобы perceived value казалось выше?

> This phenomenon has been supported by several[ studies.](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/31/4/806/1812957) Researchers agree that **the effort customers see behind any given product can boost their perceptions about the service and quality of the product** because they’ll feel gratitude. Even when the quality of the service remains the same, consumers feel like they should reciprocate the efforts of the provider. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#8b622e0c-6c18-49a4-b745-6b7630df2372)  

> This is actually a description of an experiment performed by [Harvard researchers Buell and Norton](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=40158). And what did they find? **People didn’t mind waiting when they saw the work that was unfolding.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#267fdb3a-c18c-464e-97a3-39344c5a1d3c)  

> This **illusion of labor behind the online self-service was meant to replace the effort that people normally see** when they take care of the matter personally. As Buell and Norton put it, the labor illusion should replace the blood, sweat, and tears of real-life workers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#8565b976-8137-41b6-9019-ea63a096f327)  

> But the point is not to educate the customer. The point is to **show them the value** behind the product. To let the customer picture the manufacturing process in their head and imagine the brewers working hard to deliver the best possible experience to their table. Essentially, the product is being described in the way it deserves to be described. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#012b8bf1-2b71-4e99-87b4-234888825129)

> Witty wordsmithing is not the only way to highlight the value of your product. The first thing everybody learns in behavioral economics is how the environment can shape our behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#8f99ad4a-5666-4e42-9fb7-103ed0e82dc9)  

> [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1096348009344212?journalCode=jhtd) shows that a restaurant’s physical environment has a direct influence on the customers’ price perception. The authors explicitly advise managers to **provide customers with an environment that reflects the value of their products.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-nudge-your-customers-by-adding-the-right-words-inside-be-18d2223af77#104eb2cc-546d-47b7-ab5a-9166c7d302b3)  

> * **Show the customer the value behind the product**. Describe the effort and time you’ve put into it to provide the customer with the best product or service possible.
> * **Use descriptive, vivid, and engaging language**, and be sure to share the story behind your product.
> * **Context matters.** The perceived value of your product also depends on the form and the environment. Don’t underestimate it. It’s often more important than the product itself.
