## Highlights

> The article could have contained valuable information. It probably did, and you know it. But you just refused to read it because **it seemed too hard to read.** Maybe it was an enjoyable, well-written article, but if it seems like too much work, people won’t even bother to start reading. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#c4c17e57-71e2-48e7-a76c-1abdea2a072e)  

> If you want a customer to do something, not only does it need to be easy to do, **it also needs to feel easy to do.**This is called **perceived effort.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#2e3fb043-7f9b-4aef-9bbe-2c8ccd053d03)  

> In fact, research by CEB Global, summed up in the book[ _The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty_](https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Experience-Conquering-Battleground-Customer/dp/1591845815)_,_ points out that objective obstacles account only for a third of how difficult customers think something is. And the other two-thirds? **That’s how customers feel about it.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#93a63829-6476-4995-9d73-a79870b76cd5)  

> There’s a[ study by researchers from the University of Michigan ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02189.x?journalCode=pssa)in which the authors explore this phenomenon. They gave people short scripts with a description of an exercise routine. One group of people received a hard-to-read font, while the other was given an easy-to-read Arial font.

Похоже исследование было у Nathalie Nahai

> The same goes for the business environment. In a [similar study,](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.347) researchers gave people descriptions of the same phone, written in an easy and hard-to-read font, and explored the impact on postponing their decision to buy. **41% postponed the purchase when the font was difficult to read**,compared to only 17% of the participants given the easy-to-read font**.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#b1e38732-d90c-417d-88d1-4afc8c4b8565)  

> either quickly and effortlessly (so-called **heuristics**, or Type 1 reasoning) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#ffde4172-daf6-4430-9c84-2ede6a0c6ded)  

> By making the instruction more structured, the customer will perceive the same process as much easier. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#cadd5615-82a4-4c55-9d82-7d25714a7b3a)  

> * **If you want your customers to do something, they have to perceive it as easy**. If they infer that it will take a lot of effort, they just won’t do it.
> * **Information has to be easy to read.** Whether it’s a set of instructions or a product description, make sure you use an easy-to-read font.
> * **Use words that imply a feeling of ease** – like “easy”, “simple”, or “it’s enough to” and **tell your customers that the action won’t take much time.** This will reassure them and they will be more likely to do it.
> * **Structure the instructions for what you want your customers to do**. People like structure, and if customers see it, they will perceive the task as less demanding.
> * **Chunk bigger tasks into smaller pieces** that seem like they won’t take much time, and let them clearly see their progress. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lower-the-perceived-effort-to-nudge-your-customers-to-action-ins-18d222312fb#59aaa9d0-a7f3-4e1b-b64f-ad686711023e)
