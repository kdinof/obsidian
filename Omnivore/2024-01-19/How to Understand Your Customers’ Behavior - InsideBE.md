## Highlights

> We may not have done the best possible job of getting you to read this article (although if you’ve got this far our chances of you finishing it are reasonably good), but we did do something very important. **Instead of focusing on why you might read this article, we started by thinking about reasons why you might not**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#2225b886-52f0-4179-b034-0a6df6967857)  

> The question that keeps us awake at night is: “What’s it going to take to make people act?” But we really should be asking ourselves: “What’s keeping people from doing what we want?” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#34680f25-e60e-41c9-af13-76bb0a88a57f)  

> “Effective marketing entails strengthening GO signals and weakening the STOP signals” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#c3aa4544-3501-4be5-bd0d-368b9cb5dc10)  

> _“People systematically default to searching for additive transformations, and consequently overlook subtractive transformations.”_ 
> 
> The authors continue:
> 
> _“Additive ideas come to mind quickly and easily, but_ **_subtractive ideas require more cognitive effort._** _Because people are often moving fast and working with the first ideas that come to mind, they_ **_end up accepting additive solutions without considering subtraction at all.”_** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#06032e2a-3a16-4228-888e-aad254c6a83d)  

> These “headwinds” can be broken down into four groups: **Human Nature, Cultural Factors, System Factors, and Competitive Forces.** Here’s a simple visual of a windsock to remind us of the different headwinds. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#e0bb6e25-ab48-4c06-b709-dedc8c2c3862)  

> Optimism Bias leads us to believe that unfortunate things are less likely to happen to us than they are to other people. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#edb4ec38-b8a3-4914-9de1-92730e9fd505)  

> **Survivorship bias makes us more likely to notice tactics or programs that have succeeded,** as they tend to be more visible and more enduring **than those that have failed.**  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#c633e5ff-5da4-4bd6-989d-dab05b9b6930)  

> The same life insurance company had an established business in Asia, but like the category as a whole, growth in Asian countries had been slower than expected. One reason for this is that in general, [Asian cultures tend to be more interdependent than independent](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170118-how-east-and-west-think-in-profoundly-different-ways). In many countries in **Asia, the cultural norm is that families will take care of each other.** The interdependent nature of most Asian cultures means that extended family will help provide for family members in times of distress and loss. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#f8b8a8ac-5e65-4eec-9ad8-d403dd2b7b21)  

> You can read a fascinating case study about addressing cultural barriers between women and men in this article on [How One Small Change in a Tampax Tampon Design Made a Big Difference for Customers](https://insidebe.com/articles/psychology-behind-product-design/) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#fda0b47c-8af0-47d6-805f-deef01ff2277)  

> **Make sure you have both the perspectives of insiders and outsiders.** If your team consists of people from a variety of different cultural backgrounds and experiences, you can use their innate understanding of cultures they’re familiar with to detect and understand potential cultural barriers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#70c037ba-5652-4a2a-bf9b-c6203021b25e)  

> One under-used research approach is to ask people to show you how they would go about making a choice, or carrying out a behavior [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#f61525ca-3c83-4e91-a6ad-663601082a12)  

> [An inspired program by Saatchi and Saatchi Oslo](https://saatchi.com/pl-PL/news/try-my-hybrid/) overcame this barrier by putting out a casting call to existing Prius owners and asking them if they would let prospective Prius drivers test drive with them.
> 
> The existing owners were featured on social media so that people interested in testing a Prius could find someone near them. The program cleverly uses a number of psychological effects — [social proof ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%5Fproof)in that it shows you that people near you and who likely have some of the same connections as you drive a Prius; and [choice-supportive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive%5Fbias) (the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected) in the owners, **making them far more convincing than any sales person at a Toyota dealership could ever be!** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#2647325a-76dc-4aee-8768-400c7a617549)  

> Simply asking people to map out the process of choice and discussing this with them will reveal headwinds that could derail the potential chooser on their journey. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#af2dc1fc-2f76-4d77-a2bc-2b98008d580e)  

> The nature of a category and the actions of competitors can create formidable barriers. This doesn’t mean you should obsessively focus on every competitor’s action. But **it’s important to think about how your competitors might be creating headwinds that make what you’re selling a more difficult, less intuitive, or less rewarding choice.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#24e21991-8132-4fa4-8fe6-c4ec0349082b)  

> If you recognize this, you may choose to use your competitor’s dominant position to your advantage, which is exactly what Avis did back in 1962, with their famous ads that read: “When your No. 2 you try harder” ([click here to read an article and watch a short video that explains some of the behavioral insights behind challenger brands](https://thechallengerproject.com/blog/2013/challenger-brands-human-nature)). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#cb5093a8-2010-4f81-8225-51c8d053669e)  

> But just as a skateboarder uses the obstacles in their terrain to give them the speed and direction for their moves, he or she knows the importance of understanding the nature of the obstacle before using it as a launchpad for tricks. A phrase skaters use is “learn your obstacles and their possibilities.” Similarly with your competitors — **if you understand what is making the decision to choose your brand or business over theirs more difficult, you might also find some opportunities for leverage.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#ce1e1015-0dac-4340-a2e5-d3d024b58fc2)  

> In short, **why people might not do what you want them to is the question you and your team should be asking before you even consider how you can motivate them.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#ee1ea275-9b5b-42ef-9694-e7e895624835)  

> * Before you think about how you can get people to do something, think about why they might not do it.
> * To reveal these barriers and headwinds, you need to be systematic. The “Barrier Windsock” can act as a reminder of the different kinds of barriers: human nature, cultural aspects, systems/infrastructure, competitive forces
> * Be a guinea pig — go through the decision-making and purchase process yourself; then document anything that gives you pause for thought, creates uncertainty, or requires mental or physical effort.
> * When it comes to understanding competitive barriers, get your gum shoes out and think like a private investigator! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-your-customers-behavior-inside-be-18d207e9a7d#66c68c26-2e10-4173-93d6-e0386b96785a)
