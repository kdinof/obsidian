## Highlights

> So, without further ado, here are 4 [consumer psychology](https://insidebe.com/articles/ways-to-reduce-pain-of-paying/) and behavioral economics tips on how to improve customer experience **by making waiting a lot more pleasant for your customers.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#458ca6b2-899f-41dc-a160-551ae832faaf)  

> As they’re already engaged while waiting in line, they **feel like the attraction has already started**. To find out about some other ways Disney uses psychology to create a magical experience, be sure to check out [this article about how they have perfectly mastered the psychology of waiting](https://insidebe.com/articles/decoded-how-disney-are-masters-of-the-psychology-of-waiting-in-lines/). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#f1068218-3e42-4330-bc63-486b38485cd2)  

> Another example of how to get people started can be seen in a walk-in clinic. While people were in the waiting room, waiting to be seen by a medical service provider,[ they were approached by the nurse first](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.487.3938&rep=rep1&type=pdf). The nurse recorded the patient’s name, symptoms and identified whether the patient should be checked by the doctor or a registered nurse. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#4eb34eee-083d-4da8-8425-cd2e7b5a01a6)  

> There are plenty of ways of doing this – letting the customers unload a cart while there are still people ahead in line, giving customers a menu to look at while waiting to be served, taking patients from the waiting room to an exam room to wait for the doctor there, or a voicemail greeting customers when they call, asking them to fill out paperwork before reaching the service agent. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#e471d883-7749-461b-bd61-ae5322f3a98b)  

> At Houston airport, this issue was so big that[ passengers regularly filed complaints](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html) about the long waiting times. Executives noticed one thing – even though passengers were **waiting around 7 minutes** at the baggage claim, it took them just one minute to get there from their gates. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#3d03f9c7-581d-4b2e-91ff-afe383e13991)  

> And as (not only) behavioral economics research shows, [with an occupied mind, time feels like it goes faster.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685813/) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#81fee14b-a46e-4019-b8bb-3e05dcd4ad3e)  

> According to their results, music didn’t influence the perceived waiting time **unless the callers could choose the music according to their taste.** Giving people more than one option has been proven to [not only increase sales ](http://web.missouri.edu/~segerti/capstone/SingleOptionAversion.pdf)and [improve customer retention strategy](https://insidebe.com/articles/tips-to-increase-customer-retention-part-1/) but can help improve the overall customer experience of your service as well.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#7f0b7ea1-4882-4a97-b580-30e2df7cd8d2)  

> And the same thing applies when it comes to waiting. When customers need to wait, **you need to tell them why**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#c6ee3deb-0b1d-4538-bb54-e65c19eac5f2)  

> Plus, there’s a thing in behavioral science called [fundamental attribution error](https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html) (also known as correspondence bias) – **we tend to draw conclusions about someone’s personality from their actions,** and we fail to consider the situation the person is in. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#d2b031e2-d247-4820-ba8f-21cad423342a)  

> The fact is, **any given reason is better than none**, as shown in [a famous psychological experiment](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-23568-001) from the late 70s. Researchers were exploring what it takes for people to be okay with someone cutting in line. They approached people waiting in line for a copy machine and asked them to let them use it first. 
> 
> When providing no reason at all, only 60% of people let them cut in line. The percentage rose to 94% when they explained that they had an important meeting in 5 minutes and needed to make copies urgently. 
> 
> But they also tried a silly reason – “Do you mind if I use the xerox machine before you because I have to make copies?” And it truly is a silly reason – of course, everybody was waiting in line because they needed to make copies. But in this case, **93% of people let the researcher skip ahead.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#ef793a42-088d-474d-99b0-7acff82164b0)  

> That way you eliminate your customers’ uncertainties. In behavioral economics, uncertainty is a well-known, hard-wired cognitive bias. **If people don’t know what’s happening, they feel endangered** and [tend to get out of such situations](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/ambiguity-uncertainty-aversion/). Not exactly the customer experience any business is looking for! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#2e6bec51-0dc3-4363-b503-d298e9360837)  

> * **Make your customers feel like whatever they came for has already started.** Even unloading a shopping cart or filling out paperwork while they’re waiting will make them feel the time is passing more quickly.
> * **Keep your customers’ minds occupied.** Time feels like it runs faster when we have something to do.
> * **Tell customers the reason why they are waiting**. Without knowing why, customers will blame you for their frustration and the waiting will seem even longer.
> * **Remove customers’ uncertainties** by telling them how long something will take. Any uncertainty the customers may feel can frustrate them and make the whole experience worse.
