## Highlights

> The foundation concepts he describes are three core tenets of making the impossible possible: Hardware and Technology (the foundation), Software Technology, and Game Design. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-inspiration-notes-hideo-kojima-s-making-the-impossible-possi-18d2f4c99d9#194281b0-bde7-4a5b-a0ed-9582053d89ff)  

> Game Design is depicted as the ladder created to get over the barrier of impossibility and Software/Hardware Technologies are the grounds on which Game Design sits. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-inspiration-notes-hideo-kojima-s-making-the-impossible-possi-18d2f4c99d9#64dec2cf-e592-4cc8-b69c-373975215bce)  

> Constraints create new opportunities [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-inspiration-notes-hideo-kojima-s-making-the-impossible-possi-18d2f4c99d9#d3c99a71-79a9-4e14-93a5-2a26d013ff87)  

> Don’t be dependent on technology to improve and find ways to drastically push the existing capabilities. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-inspiration-notes-hideo-kojima-s-making-the-impossible-possi-18d2f4c99d9#9b99352d-8ed8-445c-a405-425093f72e49)  

> Tech is dynamic and moves fast, and if you design with current paradigms in mind constantly, you may miss the shift. This means design usually adopts interaction patterns of previous paradigms and there is this awkward phase.
