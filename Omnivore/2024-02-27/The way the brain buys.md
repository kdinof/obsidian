## Highlights

> IT MAY have occurred to you, during the course of a dismal trawl round a supermarket indistinguishable from every other supermarket you have ever been into, to wonder why they are all the same. The answer is more sinister than depressing. It is not because the companies that operate them lack imagination. It is because they are all versed in the science of persuading people to buy things—a science that, thanks to technological advances, is beginning to unlock the innermost secrets of the consumer's mind. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#4c3cd643-57da-47b7-a195-f2bc9ee66c46)  

> In the Sainsbury's in Hatch Warren, Basingstoke, south-west of London, it takes a while for the mind to get into a shopping mode. This is why the area immediately inside the entrance of a supermarket is known as the “decompression zone”. People need to slow down and take stock of the surroundings, even if they are regulars. In sales terms this area is a bit of a loss, so it tends to be used more for promotion. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#221673de-adf8-4b46-aa30-3c2c9d610f63)  

> Immediately to the left in Sainsbury's is another familiar sight: a “chill zone” for browsing magazines, books and DVDs, tempting impromptu purchases and slowing customers down. But those on a serious mission will keep walking ahead—and the first thing they come to is the fresh fruit and vegetables section. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#87664fcf-3041-4798-b07a-1953fa666371)  

> For shoppers, this makes no sense. Fruit and vegetables can be easily damaged, so they should be bought at the end, not the beginning, of a shopping trip. But psychology is at work here: selecting good wholesome fresh food is an uplifting way to start shopping, and it makes people feel less guilty about reaching for the stodgy stuff later on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#6114dbc0-10ce-45bc-b8de-57bb7c6e6d24)  

> Shoppers already know that everyday items, like milk, are invariably placed towards the back of a store to provide more opportunity to tempt customers. This is why pharmacies are generally at the rear, even in “convenience” stores. But supermarkets know shoppers know this, so they use other tricks, like placing popular items halfway along a section so that people have to walk all along the aisle looking for them. The idea is to boost “dwell time”: the length of time people spend in a store. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#775a01a0-341a-45c6-8148-3ea4e3590cad)  

> Path Intelligence, a British company working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, tracked people's phones at Gunwharf Quays, a large retail and leisure centre in Portsmouth—not by monitoring calls, but by plotting the positions of handsets as they transmit automatically to cellular networks. It found that when dwell time rose 1% sales rose 1.3%. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#3460f577-262a-4e58-9042-876890904518)  

> They do it for the smell of freshly baked bread, which makes people hungry and thus encourages people to buy not just bread but also other food, including frozen stuff. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#ecf3a637-7244-451d-b8b0-01fc1cefea28)  

> The Aroma Company, which Mr Harrop founded, has put the smell of coconut into the shops of Thompson, a British travel agent. Some suntan oils smell of coconut, so the scent is supposed to remind people of past holidays. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#9cc3d0be-d919-4364-ab88-83bc4b4a895e)  

> We are just at the frontier of the subconscious [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#0b3242e5-8e8d-4667-8ef1-219cfcbfd07c)  

> It uses image-recognition software to scan the pictures from security cameras of shoppers while they are making their selections. It is capable of looking at the actions of hundreds of thousands of people. It can measure how many went straight to one brand, the number that dithered and those that compared several, at the same time as sorting shoppers by age, gender and ethnicity. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#8440e7a8-f27e-4cce-aed9-1d10a2576357)  

> Typically it would take them two minutes, with the majority going straight to one brand. “This shows their mind was already made up; they were on autopilot,” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#e5c5fa34-d601-4dcf-afd9-2c541fdda15a)  

> Another study in a supermarket some 12% of people spent 90 seconds looking at juices, studying the labels but not selecting any. In supermarket decision-making time, that is forever. This implies that shoppers are very interested in juices as a healthy alternative to carbonated drinks, but are not sure which to buy. So there is a lot of scope for persuasion. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#2a9e9128-2e45-45e1-b766-07617717db66)  

> Reducing the selection on offer might help too. Cassie Mogilner of Stanford University and her colleagues found in a study that consumers like unfamiliar products to be categorised—even if the categories are meaningless. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#7b87fffa-4b65-47f6-9129-dec2bed89a3d)  

> People say they leave shops empty-handed more often because they are “unable to decide” than because prices are too high, says Mr Bearse. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#0d6bd638-0c81-441a-bb3b-5278bf0e1669)  

> Deloitte found that customers using fitting rooms convert at a rate of 85% compared with 58% for those that do not do so. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#ef62354e-eea9-45ad-82c3-6b8d813f9271)  

> The basic mechanisms to do this are already in place. A store or loyalty card can be fitted with an RFID tag to identify customers on arrival. A device on the trolley could monitor everything placed in it, check with past spending patterns and nudge customers: “You have just passed the Oriels, which you usually buy here.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-way-the-brain-buys-18de9193aed#5bbc64cf-562a-471c-a302-2cf018683f3d)  

> Barry Salzman, the chief executive of YCD Multimedia in New York, has big plans for the area around a cash till. He is using digital video screens displaying ads that relate to what someone is buying and which can also be linked with facial-recognition software to refine the displays according to the customer's age or sex. His system is already being used in Aroma Espresso Bars in America to present, say, an advert for a chocolate croissant to someone buying only a cappuccino.
