## Highlights

> There are four key steps that growth teams can apply in how product and design collaborate that we’ve seen time and time again lead to increased user and UX-centricity, and improved growth outcomes.
> 
> 1. **Share responsibility:** co-ownership of growth team outcomes
> 2. **Default to inclusivity:** prioritise greater collaboration, fewer handovers
> 3. **Implement quality principles:** define and leverage context appropriate quality bars
> 4. **Adapt ways of working**: tailor the approach to different types of growth work [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-product-x-design-collaboration-in-high-performing-growth-tea-18e500126dc#1358c403-f4a3-4e16-9ab2-27c90e16b7db)  

> Growth is a team sport, and the best growth outcomes come from teams that feel and work with a sense of shared ownership over those outcomes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-product-x-design-collaboration-in-high-performing-growth-tea-18e500126dc#aa60d38c-920e-4091-b612-9c88fa71869b)  

> While growth teams might not typically be building core product features, they are often responsible for ensuring users and their teams can realise the promised value via delightful and memorable experiences, in ways that are ethically sound.

> **✅ Best Practice:** It’s important to bring this concept front and centre to how growth teams think about their work. But it’s equally important to take a flexible and pragmatic approach. Your aim should be to establish the growth team as a strong partner to product teams. Here are some practical steps to take:
> 
> 1. Define several high-quality principles and use them actively in Design and Product Reviews. Co-design these principles across core product and growth teams.
> 2. Consider making some principles non-negotiable for any experience you’re shipping to end-users.
> 3. Ensure strong collaboration in execution with the core product teams, especially when any growth work is on surfaces owned by those teams. Co-plan and design experiments so they become a ‘joined-up’ activity and use the quality principles to created shared understanding and alignment around the experience.

> **✅ Best Practices:** 
> 
> * Host a Design Review session at least every week
> * Use “quality principles” for your product to articulate design decisions
> * Invite PMs as occasional guests to the session to make decision-making more transparent
> * For Design Managers: allow your team to share feedback first, facilitate this discussion, and summarise your take last
> * Document action items after each review session and keep each other accountable [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-product-x-design-collaboration-in-high-performing-growth-tea-18e500126dc#2d98af23-e2d3-4b3c-9baf-c45df4b77092)
