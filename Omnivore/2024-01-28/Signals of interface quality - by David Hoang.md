## Highlights

> Quality is the degree to which an object or entity (e.g., process, product, or service) satisfies specific attributes or requirements. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/signals-of-interface-quality-by-david-hoang-18d50403fc1#8cb3f86b-6713-449a-abc9-6f2a48468db3)  

> Companies talk about quality and how important it is in their culture. The number one problem I see is most don’t set the standard clearly to understand. The quality of manufacturing at Old Navy is different at Banana Republic. Set the standard of expectation so it’s clear to you and what you’re building.
