## Highlights

> But both neuroscience and social science suggest that we are more optimistic than realistic. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimism-bias-by-tali-sharot-extract-neuroscience-the-guardi-18d3f53c722#dd1cfa86-3917-4ea2-97ee-5d9746125ccf)  

> Overly positive assumptions can lead to disastrous miscalculations – make us less likely to get health checkups, apply sunscreen or open a savings account, and more likely to bet the farm on a bad investment. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimism-bias-by-tali-sharot-extract-neuroscience-the-guardi-18d3f53c722#646d9d67-0bf3-4348-af1a-f344f0088364)  

> But the bias also protects and inspires us: it keeps us moving forward rather than to the nearest high-rise ledge. Without optimism, our ancestors might never have ventured far from their tribes and we might all be cave dwellers, still huddled together and dreaming of light and heat. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimism-bias-by-tali-sharot-extract-neuroscience-the-guardi-18d3f53c722#158ea58c-a221-452a-a18b-cb48cab1c3dd)  

> It is easy to see why cognitive time travel was naturally selected for over the course of evolution. It allows us to plan ahead, to save food and resources for times of scarcity and to endure hard work in anticipation of a future reward. It also lets us forecast how our current behaviour may influence future generations.

> Patients with damage to their hippocampus are unable to recollect the past, but they are also unable to construct detailed images of future scenarios. They appear to be stuck in time. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimism-bias-by-tali-sharot-extract-neuroscience-the-guardi-18d3f53c722#74b1412c-c683-4d1e-b1a5-64d2f9c688af)  

> directing our thoughts of the future toward the positive is a result of our frontal cortex's communicating with subcortical regions deep in our brain. The frontal cortex, a large area behind the forehead, is the most recently evolved part of the brain. It is larger in humans than in other primates and is critical for many complex human functions such as language and goal setting.

> This matched the enhanced activity we observed in two critical regions of the brain: the amygdala, a small structure deep in the brain that is central to the processing of emotion, and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), an area of the frontal cortex that modulates emotion and motivation.
