## Highlights

> **The design leader is a master at design integration.** They can advocate for design at the highest business tables. They have high IQ, can manage upwards, can shield the team from politics. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-verifiedinsider-p-exploring-high-imp-19246f46994#7cdcd103-d7c1-4789-996d-63fe8fbbf218)  

> **They have strong internal sponsors.** Design reports to the correct person in the organisation allowing design to influence at product and business levels. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-verifiedinsider-p-exploring-high-imp-19246f46994#b19d7d6a-fea7-454b-b3f3-3891720026da)  

> **They value design away from pure pixel-perfect UI. They recognise products, services and customer experience are all interconnected.** They take an integrated view of their customer journey to create end to end experience for them.

How to measure value of design 

> **Equally world-class engineers.** I’ve found the best design teams I’ve worked with don’t just outsource engineering they invest in design and eng sitting close together, having engineers who value and understand design and vice versa. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-verifiedinsider-p-exploring-high-imp-19246f46994#77fa05d2-dad5-49c6-be0c-6a7c624428ea)  

> 1. **They hire top notch visual design talent (focus on craft)**
> 
> More companies are reaching out to me talking about how they need to “level-up design craft” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-verifiedinsider-p-exploring-high-imp-19246f46994#41eab8ab-0d83-4ff6-bf8e-cce4d8b830f6)
