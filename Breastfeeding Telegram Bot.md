# Description
---

# Prompt

# Context
I want to build a Telegram bot that will help me and my wife log all of our new born son actions like: sleeping, breastfeeding and pooping. The bot should log time and action, and log each action into a Google spreadsheet. 

# Bot Requirements 
- The bot should log sleeping, breastfeeding and pooping action.
- The bot has to log the start time and the end time of sleeping 
- The bot has to log the start time and the end time of breastfeeding.
- The bot should log the time of pooping.
- Each of these actions should have its ID. This means that each of the breastfeeding and sleeping IDs should have two logs: the start time and the end time. The pooping action ID should have only one log.
- These actions should be written in a Google table as a new row. 
- For each ID for pooping and breastfeeding action there should one more row that calculate ti duration between the start time and the end time.

# UI Requirements
The bot should have only buttons for
- Start breastfeeding / End Breastfeeding.
- Start Sleeping / End Sleeping
- Pooping

The user should also have an option to input the link to their own spreadsheet to use it for logging actions. 

# User Flow example
I start feeding my baby, open the telegram bot, and click the "Start breastfeeding" button. The button changed to "End breastfeeding" and the action was logged in a Google spreadsheet. 
After my baby finishes feeding I click the "End breastfeeding" button. The button changed to "Start breastfeeding" and the action was logged in a Google spreadsheet. 
After the end of each breastfeeding or sleeping, a new row should appear in Google Spreadsheet with the same ID that calculates the duration time between the start and the finish logs in the action.


# Example of the spreadsheet
|     |               |          |                   |     |
| --- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | --- |
| ID  | Action Type   | Action   | Time              |     |
| 1   | breastfeeding | start    | 4/25/2025 4:16:53 |     |
| 1   | breastfeeding | end      | 4/25/2025 4:25:53 |     |
| 1   | breastfeeding | duration | 8.999999998       |     |
| 2   | sleeping      | start    | 4/25/2025 5:32:53 |     |
| 2   | sleeping      | end      | 4/25/2025 7:14:53 |     |
| 2   | sleeping      | duration | 102               |     |


# Your Goal 
Please generate a tasks list for this project.

Each task should be well explained like for junior developer

Make this tasks list in markdown format




# To Do

## Project Task List

Below is a step-by-step task list written for a junior developer. Follow each task in order.  

---

### 1. Initialize your project  
- **What to do:**  
  - Create a new directory for your bot project.  
  - Initialize it with your preferred language (e.g. `npm init` for Node.js, `pipenv --python 3.x` for Python).  
  - Commit a basic `.gitignore` and a `README.md` that explains the project purpose.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  You need a clean workspace, version control, and basic project metadata before writing any code.

---

### 2. Set up Telegram Bot credentials  
- **What to do:**  
  - Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram to create a new bot.  
  - Copy your **Bot Token** (a long string).  
  - Store it securely (e.g. in a `.env` file).  
- **Why it matters:**  
  This token lets your code authenticate with Telegram’s API and receive button presses.

---

### 3. Enable Google Sheets API & get credentials  
- **What to do:**  
  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
  - Create or select a project.  
  - Enable the **Google Sheets API**.  
  - Create a **Service Account** and grant it “Editor” role on your Google Sheet.  
  - Download the JSON key file and save it as `credentials.json` in your project (don’t commit to Git).  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Your bot needs permission to read and write rows in the user’s spreadsheet.

---

### 4. Install dependencies  
- **What to do (Node.js example):**  
  ```bash
  npm install telegraf googleapis dotenv
  ```  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - `telegraf`: a popular Telegram bot framework.  
  - `googleapis`: Google’s official library for Sheets access.  
  - `dotenv`: loads your `.env` file.  

---

### 5. Load configuration & authenticate services  
- **What to do:**  
  - Create a file (e.g. `config.js` or `config.py`) to read from `.env` (bot token, default Spreadsheet ID).  
  - Initialize the Telegram bot instance using the token.  
  - Initialize the Google Sheets client using the service account key.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Centralizing config and auth simplifies the rest of your code.

---

### 6. Implement “/set_sheet” command  
- **What to do:**  
  - Add a command handler so the user can send `/set_sheet <SPREADSHEET_ID>`.  
  - Validate the ID by attempting to read the first row.  
  - Store the ID in memory (or persist in a JSON file) for subsequent actions.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Users must link their own sheet to log data.  

---

### 7. Design in-memory state for actions  
- **What to do:**  
  - Create a simple object to track the current “open” breastfeeding or sleeping interval, e.g.:  
    ```js
    {
      breastfeeding: { id: null, startTime: null },
      sleeping:      { id: null, startTime: null },
      nextId: 1
    }
    ```  
- **Why it matters:**  
  You need to know when an action was started in order to record its end and compute duration.

---

### 8. Build button interface  
- **What to do:**  
  - Use Telegram **inline keyboard** buttons labeled:  
    - [ Start Breastfeeding ] / [ End Breastfeeding ]  
    - [ Start Sleeping ]      / [ End Sleeping ]  
    - [ Pooping ]  
  - Send or update a single message with these buttons whenever the user interacts.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  This gives a clean UI and prevents users from typing text commands.

---

### 9. Handle “Start X” actions  
- **What to do:**  
  - For “Start Breastfeeding” and “Start Sleeping” button callbacks:  
    1. Read the shared `nextId`.  
    2. Record `startTime = new Date()`.  
    3. Update `state[X].id` and `state[X].startTime`.  
    4. Append a row to the sheet:  
       ```
       [id, actionType, "start", startTime]
       ```  
    5. Increment `nextId` if this is a brand-new interval.  
    6. Swap the button label to “End X”.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Logging the start event and reserving an ID is the first half of the interval.

---

### 10. Handle “End X” actions  
- **What to do:**  
  - For “End Breastfeeding” and “End Sleeping” callbacks:  
    1. Read `state[X].id` and `state[X].startTime`.  
    2. Record `endTime = new Date()`.  
    3. Compute duration in seconds:  
       ```js
       const seconds = (endTime - startTime) / 1000;
       ```  
    4. Append two rows to the sheet:  
       5. `[id, actionType, "end", endTime]`  
       6. `[id, actionType, "duration", seconds]`  
    7. Reset `state[X]` (clear id & startTime).  
    8. Swap the button back to “Start X”.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Completes the interval and stores both the end timestamp and computed duration.

---

### 11. Handle “Pooping” action  
- **What to do:**  
  - For the “Pooping” button callback:  
    1. Read and increment `nextId`.  
    2. Record `time = new Date()`.  
    3. Append two rows:  
       4. `[id, "pooping", "poop", time]`  
       5. `[id, "pooping", "duration", 0]` (you can choose to omit duration or always 0).  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Pooping has no “end,” but you still want a unique ID and consistent table format.

---

### 12. Error handling & user feedback  
- **What to do:**  
  - If Google Sheets API calls fail, catch errors and send a Telegram message like “Could not log to your sheet—please check your Sheet ID or permissions.”  
  - If a user clicks “End X” without having started it, reply “You haven’t started sleeping yet!”  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Clear error messages help users self-correct and avoid confusion.

---

### 13. Testing  
- **What to do:**  
  - Manually test each button flow in your own Telegram chat.  
  - Verify rows appear correctly in your Google Sheet.  
  - Test edge cases:  
    - Clicking “End” twice  
    - Calling `/set_sheet` with an invalid ID  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Ensures reliability before your wife and you depend on it daily.

---

### 14. Deployment & hosting  
- **What to do:**  
  - Choose a hosting platform (Heroku, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, etc.).  
  - Set your environment variables (`BOT_TOKEN`, `SHEET_ID`, path to credentials).  
  - Deploy and configure a webhook or long-polling.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  A 24/7 running bot is needed to log events in real time.

---

### 15. Documentation & README  
- **What to do:**  
  - Update your `README.md` with:  
    - Setup steps (env vars, credentials, installing deps)  
    - How to run locally (`npm start` / `python bot.py`)  
    - How to deploy  
    - List of bot commands and buttons  
- **Why it matters:**  
  Good documentation helps onboard you (and anyone else) in the future.

---

Once you’ve completed these tasks, you’ll have a fully functioning Telegram bot that logs all baby actions—sleeping, breastfeeding, and pooping—directly into a Google Sheet with start/end times and durations!
