Lighting: Soft, diffused, and bright studio lighting (like a softbox). The light should be positioned slightly from the front and above
Shadows: Gentle, subtle shadows that define the folds, pockets, and the area beneath the rack, adding depth without being harsh.
Background: A clean, seamless, and plain background in a very light color or off-white that transitions smoothly from the wall to the floor.
Clean, centered, and balanced composition.
Camera Angle: Eye-level, straight-on shot. Focal Length: 85mm or 100mm prime lens
Composition: Tight crop, with the uploaded cloth filling approximately 90% of the image frame. The garment should be presented prominently, close to the camera, showcasing its details without significant empty space around it.
