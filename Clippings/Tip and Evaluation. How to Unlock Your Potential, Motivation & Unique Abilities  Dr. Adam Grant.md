They drew a clear distinction and practical takeaway: don’t ask for evaluations; ask for advice.

- What they said:
  - When you ask for “feedback,” you typically get two unhelpful extremes: cheerleaders (generic praise) or critics (global judgments). Neither reliably helps you improve.
  - The most useful input comes from “coaches,” and you can elicit coaching by asking for advice about what to do next time, not an evaluation of what you just did.
  - Meta‑analysis shows the usefulness of input depends less on it being positive/negative and more on whether it targets the task (specific, actionable) versus the self (global, identity‑level).[1]
  - A simple wording shift works: instead of “Can I get feedback?”, ask “What’s one thing I could do better next time?” This moves people to the future (advice), yields concrete tactics, and reduces defensiveness compared to past‑focused evaluations.
  - To internalize tough input, use the “second score” mindset: your “first score” is the critique you received; your “second score” is how well you take it and apply it. Aim for a 10 on the second score—even if the first one was a 3.5.

- How to apply:
  - Replace “feedback?” with “one thing to improve next time?”
  - Nudge for task‑focused specifics: “Which part should I change, and how?”
  - Collect multiple advice notes (5–8 people) and look for repeated themes; prioritize what several people independently mention.
  - After receiving input, immediately write your “second score” plan: the single change you’ll implement and by when.

## Take aways 
**Overcoming Procrastination & Boosting Creativity**

- People procrastinate not out of laziness, but to avoid negative emotions (boredom, fear, anxiety, confusion).
    
- A moderate amount of procrastination can boost creativity—waiting allows time for ideas to incubate, but too much means rushing and poor-quality results.
    
- For moderate procrastination to benefit creativity, you need to be intrinsically interested in the task; otherwise, you simply avoid it.
    

**Nurturing Motivation**

- Intrinsic motivation (doing things for their own sake or out of curiosity) leads to better focus, resilience, and creative problem-solving.
    
- If intrinsic motivation is lacking, finding a sense of _purpose_—connecting an unpleasant task to a meaningful outcome—improves persistence and effectiveness.
    
- Incentives (extrinsic rewards) are most effective for quantity, but can undermine intrinsic motivation, especially if there’s no autonomy.
    

**Improving Focus & Productivity**

- Set aside uninterrupted "quiet time" blocks for deep work; frequent digital interruptions diminish productivity and satisfaction.
    
- Align deep work with your chronotype—mornings for early birds, afternoons for night owls.
    

**Dealing with Feedback & Growth Mindset**

- The most valuable feedback is future-oriented ("What’s one thing I could do better next time?").
    
- Focus more on the process and improvement (the "slope"), not on fixed scores or outcomes—the idea of a "second score" measures not just what you did, but how well you adapted to feedback.
    
- Growth mindset is more effective when it's supported by environment and context, not just internal attitudes.
    

**Unlocking Potential**

- Raw talent is less important than motivation, opportunity, and character skills.
    
- There are three "underrated" keys to realizing your potential:
    
    1. **Embrace discomfort**: Seek out challenges and moments of awkwardness.
        
    2. **Be a sponge**: Actively seek knowledge and feedback, but learn to filter what's useful.
        
    3. **Be an imperfectionist**: Know when to aim for excellence and when "good enough" will suffice; perfectionism leads to burnout and anxiety.
        
- Early success can build momentum, but achieving all your goals can breed complacency—regularly challenge yourself and be okay with some failures.
    

**Practical Tools**

- Use "quiet time" for creative or deep tasks, and set boundaries around phone and social media use.
    
- Harness self-reflective language ("name it to tame it") for difficult emotions (like languishing).
    
- When stuck, help others with similar problems ("coach effect") to boost your own confidence and sense of efficacy.
    

**Rethinking Blind Spots & Authenticity**

- Be open to challenging your own assumptions; expose yourself to views you disagree with, but from people with intellectual integrity.
    
- True authenticity means being true to your values, not just your immediate feelings or personality.
    
- Establish boundaries and practice empathy—sincerity can be more important than radical authenticity.
    

**Interesting Ideas Live**

- Ideas become interesting and memorable when they are surprising, self-relevant, actionable, and clear.
    
- "Ideas live not because they're true but because they're interesting"—use this to make learning and self-growth engaging.
