Options for Long-Term Family Relocation (Europe, Asia, Oceania)

  

Introduction

  

A family of four (two parents, children ages 5 and infant) with Russian and Uzbek residency is seeking a long-term relocation destination outside South America. The father works remotely as a product designer with an income of around $5,000/month, and the mother is a stay-at-home parent. They currently live in Indonesia on a KITAS visa. Key priorities for their new home include a calm, nature-rich environment (near ocean, mountains, or lakes), good infrastructure, availability of international schools/universities, and opportunities for the father to possibly work in a local IT company. They are open to countries in Europe, Asia, or Oceania that offer long-term residence visas (self-sponsored digital nomad or employment-based), ideally with a path to permanent residency or citizenship. English-speaking locales are welcome but not mandatory.

  

Below is a structured comparison of several suitable countries, followed by detailed profiles. The comparison covers visa options and requirements, cost of living, education infrastructure, and pathways to residency/citizenship, as well as notes on family-friendliness (healthcare, lifestyle, nature).

Other option: Financially Independent Person (FIP) residence if passive income ≥ ~€2,000/mo (varies). Employment-based visas require a job offer and salary meeting Greek work permit standards. Lower cost than Western Europe. A family of 3 needs €4,143/mo gross in 2025 ; for family of 4, roughly €4,489 gross ($4,900). In Athens, 3BR rent ~$700; expenses are modest. Overall, Greece offers a Mediterranean lifestyle at relatively affordable cost . Dozens of international schools in Athens (21 in Athens metro ) including American, British and IB schools. A few in Thessaloniki and Crete. Public universities teach in Greek, but some English-taught programs exist; EU-recognized degrees. PR: Eligible after 5 years continuous residence (can apply for long-term EU resident status). Citizenship: After 7 years legal residence  with language/civics test. Greece allows dual citizenship .

Turkey Residence Permit (Ikamet): Foreigners can obtain a 1-2 year renewable residence permit by renting or purchasing property. No explicit minimum income, but must show ability to support family (e.g. ~$1,500–$2,000/mo). Work Visa: Possible if the father secures an IT job; requires employer sponsorship. Turquoise Card (for high-skilled) or citizenship by investment ($400k real estate) are other routes. Low cost of living. In Antalya (coastal, family-friendly city), ~$2,000/month supports a family of four comfortably  . Rents for a 3BR apartment ~$660–$970 depending on area . Prices in Turkey are much lower than EU averages due to the lira’s exchange rate, while offering a similar quality of life in developed areas  . Many private and international schools in major cities. Istanbul has ~36 international schools ; Ankara and Izmir have several. Antalya has a few international colleges catering to expats . 67 IB-curriculum schools countrywide . Universities in big cities often teach in English or have English programs (e.g. Koç, Bilkent). PR: After 8 years residence (conditioned on continuous stay and Turkish language proficiency). Citizenship: After 5 years residence (with no interruptions >6 months) and demonstrating ties & Turkish language; or immediately via investment ($400k property or $500k deposit) . Turkey allows dual citizenship.

Georgia Visa-Free Entry: Russians and many nationals can stay 360 days visa-free in Georgia, simply renewing by exit/re-entry. Temporary Residence: obtainable via work contract, business registration, or property purchase (> $100,000). No formal nomad visa needed due to liberal entry policy. The father could register as an individual entrepreneur in Georgia for tax perks and get a residence permit. Very affordable: Est. $2,000–$2,500/month for a family in Tbilisi (excluding rent) . Rents are low (nice 3BR apartment ~$500–$800). Utilities and food costs are a fraction of Western European costs. Life in Georgia is inexpensive while offering modern amenities in cities. ~16 international schools in Tbilisi   (English, French, etc., e.g. QSI Tbilisi, British International School, New School). Fewer or none outside the capital, so Tbilisi is the main option for international education. Several universities in Tbilisi; instruction mainly in Georgian/Russian, but growing number of English programs. PR: After 6 years of temporary residence one can apply for permanent residency . Citizenship: Generally after 10 years residence  (or 5 years in special cases ). Dual citizenship is restricted – Georgia typically requires renunciation, except for some cases of exception.

  

Asia

  

Country Visa Options & Requirements Cost of Living (Family of 4) Education Infrastructure Residency/Citizenship Path

Malaysia DE Rantau Digital Nomad Pass: Income ≥ $2,000/mo (≈ MYR 9,000) for primary applicant ; 12-month visa + 12-month renewal. Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H): long-term visa (5–10 years) if financial criteria met (e.g. ~MYR 1.5 million in assets, MYR 40k/month income for MM2H in Peninsular Malaysia). Work visa possible if hired locally, but local hire can be tough due to quotas. Moderate cost: ~ $1,500–$2,500/month total for a family in a smaller city. For example, a couple lives very well on $2,500 in Penang (island city) with a high-end condo ; a family of four can live comfortably on ~$3,000–$3,500. Housing is affordable (3-4BR modern condo ~$750/month ). Overall ~54% cheaper cost of living than Spain  . Excellent international schools in expat hubs. Kuala Lumpur alone has dozens of international schools (British, American, Australian curricula). Penang has several renowned international schools (e.g. Uplands, St. Christopher’s). Johor Bahru (near Singapore) also hosts international schools. Malaysia’s universities (e.g. in KL) attract international students; some courses in English. PR: Difficult – PR is granted sparingly (point-based or by marriage). Many expats use long-term visas (renew MM2H or work permits). Citizenship: After 10+ years residency, but practically very rare (Malaysia does not allow dual citizenship, so few pursue it). In short, Malaysia is great for long-term residency, but not for those seeking a new passport.

Thailand Long-Term Resident (LTR) Visa: 10-year visa for “Work-from-Thailand Professional” if income $80k/year (or $40k/year with advanced degree)  – father’s $60k/year is slightly below the high threshold but could qualify if other criteria met. Digital Nomad / SMART Visa: Thailand is launching a digital nomad visa under the SMART Visa program (SMART “T” for Talent or “S” for Startup) with specific skill/income requirements. Thai Elite Visa: 5–20 year residency against a fee (~$18,000 for 5-year). Work Permit: If hired by a Thai company, work visa/permit can be obtained (English-speaking IT jobs mostly in Bangkok). Affordable tropical lifestyle: A family can live on ~$2,000–$3,000 in many areas (excl. international school fees). Bangkok is pricier (perhaps $3,000+ for a family), but smaller cities like Chiang Mai are cheaper. For example, in Chiang Mai or a beach town, $1,500–$2,000/month can cover comfortable rent, food, transport. Thailand ranked top 30 globally for Quality of Life for expats in 2024  . Western conveniences are available at lower cost. Many international schools in Bangkok (over 100). Outside Bangkok: Chiang Mai has several (CMIS, Prem Tinsulanonda, etc.), Phuket and Pattaya have international schools due to large expat communities. Quality can be high, often following British or IB curricula. International universities are limited (some branch campuses and joint programs), but local universities may have international programs. PR: You can apply for Permanent Residence after 3+ years of work permits and meeting other criteria (quota of 100 PRs per nationality per year). Citizenship: After 5 years of PR (or extended work permit status) with Thai language proficiency. Thailand allows dual citizenship in practice (though officially case-by-case). Many expats simply renew long-term visas indefinitely rather than naturalize.

United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Dubai/Abu Dhabi as key hubs Remote Work Visa (Dubai): 1-year visa for remote workers earning ≥ $5,000/month (with proof of employment) . Allows family sponsorship; renewable annually. Job Visa: If the father finds employment in the UAE (e.g. in Dubai’s tech sector), the company sponsors a 2-3 year work visa (no minimum salary legally, but must meet profession standards). Golden Visa: 10-year residence for investors, highly skilled professionals, or those with high salary (e.g. salary > AED 30k/mo for Golden Visa talent category). High quality of life, high costs: Major expenses are rent and schooling. In Dubai or Abu Dhabi, a 3BR apartment/villa rent can range $2,500–$4,000+ per month in good areas. Monthly family living costs easily ~$4,000–$5,000 with a moderate lifestyle. Smaller emirates (Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah) are 20-30% cheaper and offer a quieter environment (e.g. many families live in these and commute). No income tax, but pricing for goods and services is similar to Western Europe. Extremely large selection of international schools (British, IB, American curriculum) – Dubai has 200+ private schools, Abu Dhabi ~100. These schools serve expats from around the world (instruction mainly in English). Quality ranges from mid-tier to world-class (with world-top universities opening campuses in UAE as well). Healthcare is modern and high-standard (mandatory insurance for residents). PR/Citizenship: UAE does not offer permanent residency or citizenship to most expats. The 10-year renewable Golden Visa is the de facto “long-term PR”. Citizenship is offered only in rare cases to distinguished individuals. However, one can reside long-term on renewed visas without issue. The UAE is extremely family-friendly (low crime, excellent infrastructure), but it’s considered a temporary residence for most.

Indonesia (Bali) (Included as reference since the family is there.) Second Home Visa: 5 or 10-year visa requiring proof of funds of IDR 2 billion (~$130k) in a local bank【source】. KITAS: work-sponsored or investor KITAS for those setting up a business or being employed. Upcoming Digital Nomad Visa: Indonesia has signaled a potential 5-year “digital nomad” visa for remote workers, but as of 2025 it’s not yet in effect. Currently, many remote workers use 6-month socio-cultural visas or renew tourist visas. Low cost, tropical setting: Bali’s cost can range from very cheap local lifestyle to moderate. A family might spend $1,500–$2,500/month in Bali for a comfortable life (private villa rent $600–$1200 depending on location, inexpensive local food, international groceries higher). Other Indonesian locales (e.g. Yogyakarta, Lombok) are even cheaper. Bali has a few international schools (e.g. Green School, Canggu Community School, Australian International School). Jakarta (the capital) has many international schools and top universities but is very urban. Healthcare in Bali is decent for routine care (international clinics), but serious cases may require travel to Jakarta or Singapore. PR: Indonesia doesn’t have a straightforward PR for expats; one can keep renewing KITAS/ITAS and eventually apply for KITAP (permanent stay permit) after several years. Citizenship: Very difficult (10+ years and Indonesian language, and Indonesia doesn’t allow dual citizenship). Bali is ideal for nature and community, but long-term formal status is evolving.

  

Oceania

  

Country Visa Options & Requirements Cost of Living (Family of 4) Education & Infrastructure Residency/Citizenship Path

Australia Skilled Independent Visa (189): Points-based PR visa for in-demand occupations (requires age <45, English proficiency, and a skilled occupation with sufficient points). For a product designer, eligibility depends on whether the role falls under a skilled category (e.g. Industrial Designer or ICT roles). Employer Sponsor (482 TSS or 186 PR): If the father secures an Australian job offer in his field, the company can sponsor a 2–4 year work visa (which can lead to PR nomination after 3 years). Working Holiday Visa: Not available for Russian/Uzbek citizens. No dedicated digital nomad visa (as of 2025). High cost, high wages: Major cities (Sydney, Melbourne) are expensive – e.g. average family of 4 expenses ~ A$6,000+ per month in Sydney. However, since the family prefers calmer areas, they might consider smaller cities (Adelaide, Perth) or regional towns, which are 20-30% cheaper. For example, in Brisbane/Gold Coast, a family might need around AU $4,000–$5,000/month. Groceries, housing, and cars are costly, but public services are excellent. World-class infrastructure: safe water, reliable power, excellent roads. Schools: Public schools are free and high quality (and generally open to temporary visa holders’ children, possibly with a small fee). Many private and international schools in each city. Universities in Australia rank in the world’s top 100 (Melbourne, Sydney, etc.) and instruction is in English. Ample nature (beaches, parks) even within metro areas; extremely family-friendly culture (playgrounds, community centers, etc.). Healthcare via Medicare is available to PRs/citizens (and some visa holders); others need private insurance. PR: Australia offers a direct PR pathway for skilled migrants (if visa 189/190 granted) – you become a permanent resident on arrival. Employer-sponsored routes can lead to PR after a few years. Citizenship: After 4 years legal residence (with at least 1 year as a PR) , one can apply for citizenship; dual citizenship is allowed. Australia consistently ranks high in quality of life and is considered one of the best countries to raise children, but entry is competitive.

New Zealand Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa: Points-based system; requires skilled job offer or high qualifications. NZ has a talent shortage list – if the father’s occupation is in demand (e.g. UX/UI Designer under ICT), he could get residency with a job offer and meet points (which include age, experience, etc.). Work to Residence: Secure a job first, then employer sponsors a work visa which can transition to residency after 2+ years. Entrepreneur Work Visa: for establishing a business in NZ (requires investment funds). No specific digital nomad visa. Moderate-High cost: Cost of living is slightly lower than Australia’s big cities, but still significant. A family of four in, say, Christchurch or Wellington might spend NZ $5,000–$6,000 per month (~USD $3,000–$3,600) for a comfortable life. Housing is the biggest expense – rents in mid-sized cities around NZ$2,500 for a 3-bedroom. Groceries and petrol are costly (island economy), but public education and healthcare are subsidized. Quality of life is exceptional, with clean air, low crime, and nature at your doorstep. Schools: Public education is free and of high standard. Many schools have outdoor-focused and holistic curricula (great for young kids). There are a few international schools (especially in Auckland) and many public schools offer support for non-English speakers. Universities (Auckland, Otago, etc.) are well regarded globally. Infrastructure is modern, though outside main cities things are quieter. The lifestyle is famously relaxed and nature-centric – “leisurely BBQ and beach” culture. Healthcare: residents and some work visa holders get access to NZ’s public healthcare, which is very good (and emergency care is free to all). PR: If granted a resident visa (either directly via skilled migration or after working 2 years), you can live indefinitely. Citizenship: After 5 years of residency (and physical presence requirements) you can apply for citizenship; New Zealand allows dual citizenship. NZ often tops rankings for safety and environmental quality. One caveat is distance – it’s far from Europe, which might matter for travel. But for a peaceful family life amid nature, it’s hard to beat.

Country Profiles and Special Considerations

  

Below are more detailed profiles of each country/group, including notes on family-friendliness, healthcare, lifestyle, and where to find nature-oriented living within each country.

  

Spain 🇪🇸

  

Spain offers a mix of Mediterranean climate, rich culture, and family-friendly lifestyle that could suit this family well. Nature & Lifestyle: Outside of the biggest cities, Spain has many calm, picturesque regions – for instance, the Costa Blanca or Costa del Sol (e.g. Alicante or Marbella area) offer beaches and mountains with a large expat community. The Balearic Islands (like Mallorca) or even the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Gran Canaria) are also popular for remote-working families seeking nature and tranquility. These areas are not as hectic as Madrid or Barcelona but still have good infrastructure.

  

Visa Options: Spain’s new Digital Nomad Visa (under the 2023 Startup Law) is a prime option for the father’s remote work. As noted, it requires about €2,762 per month for an individual, plus roughly €346 extra per child . With ~$5,000 income (~€4,500), the family meets this requirement for a family of four. The visa is initially 1 year and can be renewed up to 5 years, after which one can apply for long-term residency . An alternative is the Non-Lucrative Visa, which requires proving sufficient savings/income (around €28k/year) and forbids local economic activity – many retirees use this. However, the digital nomad visa now is preferable as it explicitly allows remote work income and even lets the holder do some freelance work for Spanish companies (up to 20% of income).

  

If the father wanted to join a local company, Spain’s tech sector is growing. Cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia have tech startups and international companies. An English-speaking expat could find opportunities especially in design or IT roles. In that case, a work visa or EU Blue Card would be the route. The Blue Card requires a high salary (e.g. in Spain, roughly >€45k/year offer). The Spanish work culture values Spanish language, but in international companies English is common.

  

Education: Spain is very accommodating for expat families. There are hundreds of international schools, including British and American schools and the globally recognized International Baccalaureate (IB) programs. For example, the Madrid area alone has 50+ international schools . Outside big cities, in regions like Alicante, Murcia, or Malaga, you’ll also find English-language schools due to large expat populations. Local public schools are free and of decent quality – some expat parents choose local schools for integration, especially since your children are young (they could pick up Spanish quickly at ages 5 and below). Bilingual education (Spanish-English) is increasingly available .

  

Healthcare: Spain has a universal healthcare system ranked among the world’s best. As residents on a visa, the family can register for public healthcare after obtaining their residency cards. Many expats are impressed with the quality of hospitals and pediatric care in Spain. Private health insurance is also relatively affordable (and often required initially for visa). For instance, under a nomad visa, you might need private insurance coverage, but once you’re a resident, you can opt into public healthcare by paying social security or using a convened plan.

  

Quality of Life: Spain was rated the #1 country for expats in 2024 by InterNations, especially for quality of life and ease of settling in . The culture is very family-oriented – children are adored and included in all aspects of life. You’ll see kids out at restaurants with parents, and there are many parks and family activities. The pace is laid-back, especially in smaller towns: expect siesta time closures and a focus on work-life balance. Safety is generally high, and foreigners report feeling welcome. English is understood in touristy and international areas, though learning some Spanish will help in daily life and is appreciated by locals.

  

Within Spain, some regions to consider for nature and calm life: Valencia (a mid-sized city by the sea, with a lower cost of living than Madrid/Barcelona and several international schools), Andalusia (towns around Malaga, or Granada – near mountains and sea), or Catalonia but outside Barcelona (for instance, Tarragona or Girona provinces). Each region has its own flair. Given your current tropical residence, the Mediterranean climate might be a nice change (warm but drier, still plenty of sun).

  

One more note: Spain’s visa and bureaucracy can be slow – processing the nomad visa might take a couple of months , and initial paperwork can be a bit detailed (police clearance, etc.). But once settled, living in Spain is generally smooth and highly rewarding for families.

  

Portugal 🇵🇹

  

Portugal is another top contender, known for its gentle climate, safety, and welcoming atmosphere. It’s smaller and generally quieter than Spain, which might suit the family’s preference for calm environments. Nature & Lifestyle: Portugal offers both beaches and mountains. For example, Algarve in the south has beautiful coastlines and a large expat community (including many families); it’s very nature-friendly (beaches, caves, hiking inland) and not overly urban. Lisbon and Porto are the two main cities – while Lisbon is a bustling capital, it’s still smaller and more laid-back than cities like New York. And within an hour of Lisbon you have surf beaches, Sintra’s forests, and rural countryside. The Azores and Madeira islands (autonomous regions of Portugal) are extremely scenic (volcanic landscapes, ocean, mountains) and have attracted remote workers (Madeira even has a Digital Nomad village in Ponta do Sol). However, schooling options on the islands are fewer than on the mainland.

  

Visa Options: Portugal’s D7 “Passive Income” Visa has been a popular route for non-EU citizens with steady income. The income requirement (around €1,600/month for a family of 4) is easily met by the father’s $5k salary . The D7 is a residency visa that leads to a 2-year residence permit (then renew for 3 years). It requires the family to live in Portugal at least 6+ months per year. Crucially, the D7 historically was meant for passive income (like investments or remote work) – remote job income is generally acceptable as long as you can show it’s stable. Applicants need to show some savings as well (enough to support ~1 year of living, e.g. >€20k in bank for a family, which you likely have from monthly income accumulation) .

  

Portugal in 2022 also introduced a Digital Nomad (D8) visa, requiring a higher income (roughly €3,480/month for a single, and proportionally more for dependents) . In your case, with a family, the D8’s threshold ~€6,960/month   might not be met by $5k, so the D7 is actually more attainable. Both D7 and D8, however, give similar residency rights. One benefit of D8 is it’s tailored to people working remotely (you’d need to show work contracts and that you work for a company outside Portugal ), whereas D7 might require you to emphasize any “passive” income (if any). Many remote workers still use D7 successfully, but by 2025 they might prefer you go the D8 route if you’re actively employed. Consult an immigration lawyer or facilitator in Portugal to decide which is best – either way, Portugal is very welcoming to foreign residents.

  

If the father ever wanted a local job: the Portuguese tech scene is growing (Lisbon is a tech hub with many startups and Web Summit was hosted there). Salaries are generally lower than in Northern Europe, but the cost of living is also lower. Language-wise, international companies operate in English.

  

Education: There are over 50 international schools in Portugal . Most are concentrated around Lisbon/Cascais/Sintra (over two dozen schools)  and Porto, plus a handful in the Algarve (which has communities of British, German expats). These schools offer various curricula: British (IGCSE/A-level), American (AP, high school diploma), and IB programs are all represented. For example, in Lisbon you have the Carlucci American International School, St. Julian’s (British/IB), and many more. If you choose a smaller city or the islands, international schooling could be the limiting factor – in Madeira, there are a couple of international schools (in Funchal). In the Algarve, there are international schools near Faro, Lagoa, etc. . Since your kids are very young, you might start with local preschools (which are inexpensive or free) and then see if you prefer international primary school later.

  

Child-friendliness: Portugal ranks among the best places to raise a family, often cited for its safety and friendly people. It was named the #1 country for family relocation in a 2024 index  (Forbes report). The Portuguese are warm and love children; you’ll find that people in restaurants or shops will happily interact with your kids. Crime rates are very low (Portugal is top 5 in the Global Peace Index). Healthcare is excellent – the National Health Service (SNS) provides low-cost or free care to residents. Expats on D7/D8 are considered residents and can access SNS after registering and getting a user number. Many doctors speak English, especially in private clinics and in areas with many tourists.

  

Cost & Taxes: Portugal is quite affordable compared to the UK or US. As shown, an average family might spend around €2,500–€3,000/month . Housing costs have risen in Lisbon, but if you live a bit outside (or in a smaller city like Braga or Coimbra), you get more value. Notably, Portugal has offered a tax program called NHR (Non-Habitual Resident) which can give foreign residents beneficial tax treatment for 10 years (e.g. possibly a flat 20% tax on local Portuguese income and 0% on certain foreign income)  . The NHR rules changed in 2024 (closing some exemptions) , but it’s worth exploring to minimize taxation on the father’s remote income. Even without NHR, Portugal’s tax on €60k would be significant (~30%+), so tax planning is key when moving. However, many feel the lifestyle trade-off is worth it.

  

Path to Citizenship: One of Portugal’s biggest draws is the relatively quick path to an EU passport. After 5 years of residency (temporary) you can apply for permanent residency or citizenship . Portugal allows dual citizenship , meaning you can keep your Russian/Uzbek passports. The citizenship process does require passing a basic Portuguese language test (A2 level – basic conversational proficiency). Portuguese is not too difficult to learn to a basic level, and 5 years is ample time (they also now allow the time on a D7/D8 to count even if you spent some time away, as long as minimum stay requirements are met). This could be a great benefit for your children’s future – a Portuguese (EU) passport gives them access to live and study anywhere in the EU.

  

In summary, Portugal offers a tranquil, safe environment (imagine weekends exploring castles, forests, or surfing on uncrowded beaches), good schools, and a welcoming path to integration. It hits the mark on nature (ocean at your feet, national parks inland) and has a very open policy to foreign remote-working families in recent years.

  

Greece 🇬🇷

  

Greece provides a mix of Mediterranean island life, historic culture, and a relaxed pace that might appeal strongly to the family – especially if the image of “afternoons under olive trees and warm summer nights on a white-washed island” is enticing  . With thousands of islands and a mountainous mainland, Greece has ample opportunity for living close to nature (swimming, hiking) while still in reach of modern amenities.

  

Locations & Lifestyle: For a calmer lifestyle, one might not live in central Athens (which is a large, hectic city), but perhaps on the outskirts or in a smaller city. Thessaloniki (Greece’s second city) is on the sea, cheaper, and has a sizable expat/student population; it’s lively but more laid-back than Athens. Other options include Crete (the largest island – cities like Chania or Heraklion have international schools and hospitals, and the interior of Crete is beautiful countryside), or smaller islands such as Rhodes or Corfu which have some expat infrastructure. However, Athens does remain the hub for international schools and jobs. Many expat families in Greece actually live in the Athens suburbs (like Kifisia or Glyfada) where it’s greener and calmer, and commute into the city if needed.

  

Visa Options: Greece’s Digital Nomad Visa is one of the more straightforward in Europe. The catch for your family is the high income requirement (~€3,500 net per month for the main applicant plus +20% spouse, +15% each child) . For a family of four, that net income bar (~€5,250) is slightly above $5k unless the income after taxes qualifies. Some sources mention it as gross income requirement – but the law specifies “after tax”. If your $5k is before tax, you might fall short. If it’s after tax, you’re on the edge. It might be possible to use savings or other assets to bolster the application if close. The nomad visa is given for 12 months and can be renewed once (total 2 years) . After that, one could potentially convert to another residence permit (for example, a Financially Independent Person visa or a work permit if by then one gets local employment).

  

An alternative is the Financially Independent Person (FIP) Visa, which Greece offers to those who can show sufficient income (commonly quoted around €2,000/month for single, +20% spouse, +15% per child). That might sum roughly €3,400/month needed for a family of 4 – your $5k meets that. The FIP visa is essentially a residency permit for non-workers (similar to Spain’s non-lucrative). It requires you to rent or buy housing in Greece and have health insurance. It’s renewable yearly. Many people from non-EU countries (e.g. some Russians, Chinese) use this to live in Greece without working locally.

  

If the father is interested in local jobs, note that Greece’s economy, while improving, is not as flush with high-paying tech jobs as Western Europe. There are some multinational companies and a budding startup scene in Athens (and an initiative to make Thessaloniki a tech hub). English-speaking jobs exist but often require some Greek knowledge or pay less than remote gigs. That said, companies like Microsoft and Pfizer have been investing in Greece recently, creating tech hubs in Athens/Thessaloniki, so opportunities might grow. With a Greek residence permit (nomad or FIP), the father could legally work for his foreign company but not for a Greek company unless he switches to a work permit.

  

Education: The primary international schools are in Athens: for example, ACS Athens, St. Catherine’s British School, Campion School, and Byron College are well-known international schools offering American or British curricula. Thessaloniki has a well-regarded American international school (Pinewood International). On Crete, there are one or two international schools (Heraklion has an English school). In other islands, international school options are limited – families might use Greek private schools or homeschool. Given your children are very young, starting in a local Greek kindergarten (perhaps with some supplementary language support) could also be an immersion approach, but down the line an international school would ease transitions if you move again or for university prep.

  

Language: Greek language is famously not easy, but learning basics would help navigate daily life especially outside tourist areas. In larger towns and with younger Greeks, English is commonly spoken (Greece ranks fairly high in English proficiency among EU countries). Still, official paperwork and local schooling are in Greek. Many expats get by with English in Athens, but in a village, Greek would be needed.

  

Healthcare: Greece has a national health system (ESY) which provides free or low-cost care to residents. However, due to economic strains, public hospitals can be hit-or-miss (great doctors, but maybe crowded facilities). Most expats and many locals use a mix of public and private healthcare. Private healthcare in Greece is relatively affordable compared to Western Europe – for instance, an appointment might cost €30-50. International health insurance plans are accepted at private hospitals in Athens and Thessaloniki. Pharmacies are abundant and often the first stop for minor ailments (Greek pharmacists often speak English and can prescribe common medications).

  

Quality of Life: Greece scored well in expat surveys, especially for the friendliness and community feel . The community aspect is strong – foreigners often note how quickly they make friends, both among locals and the expat network. Greek culture revolves around family; children typically accompany parents everywhere, and there’s a very inclusive attitude towards kids (similar to Spain). Safety is generally good, especially on islands and smaller towns (petty crime exists in some touristy spots in Athens, but violent crime is rare). The Greek lifestyle prioritizes leisure: long dinners, beach outings on weekends, and a generally slower tempo (outside business hours in Athens). One potential downside can be bureaucracy – public offices can be slow, and things like getting a residence permit might involve patience and multiple visits (and lots of stamps on paper forms). But if you managed Indonesia’s bureaucracy with KITAS, you might find Greece manageable in comparison.

  

One of the big draws is, of course, the beautiful environment: Whether it’s the Aegean Sea with crystal clear water, or the pine-covered mountains, Greece offers a very outdoorsy life. You could be raising your children in a place where weekend trips to ancient ruins or island hopping are routine . Few childhoods could be as magical as growing up near the sea in a Greek island or learning history by literally being surrounded by it.

  

Path to Residency: As noted, you can obtain permanent residence after 5 years in Greece, and citizenship after 7 years of residency (with a language exam). Greece does allow dual citizenship, so the children could eventually hold it in addition to Russian/Uzbek. That timeline is slightly longer than Portugal’s, but still relatively short.

  

In summary, Greece could be ideal if your family loves Mediterranean climate, a mix of mountains and sea, and a culture that will warmly welcome you. Ensure the income requirement can be met or consider initially renting a place and applying for the FIP visa which might be easier to fulfill financially. From the iconic sunsets to the fresh Greek cuisine (healthy Mediterranean diet!), Greece offers a wholesome environment for family life.

  

Turkey 🇹🇷

  

Turkey might not have been an obvious first choice, but it has become a very popular destination for Russian citizens in particular in recent years, due to its close proximity, relatively easy residency, and affordable living. For a family seeking nature and calm, Turkey has some standout options – notably the Mediterranean coast (Turquoise Coast) and regions like Antalya or Fethiye which are famed for their beautiful beaches and mountains.

  

Lifestyle & Locations: Antalya is worth highlighting: it’s a city on the southern coast that is large enough (pop ~1 million) to have good hospitals, malls, and schools, yet it’s much more relaxed than Istanbul. It has a significant expat and foreign resident community (including many Russians; you’ll even find Russian language schools and shops). The Taurus Mountains hug the coastline, providing plenty of nature excursions, and the climate is warm (hot summers, mild winters). Antalya has an international airport (including direct flights to Moscow and elsewhere). Within Antalya province, smaller resort towns like Alanya, Kemer, Kaş, or Side provide even quieter living – some families choose these if they want a more village feel (though for schooling you might then commute to Antalya city or use smaller local private schools).

  

Another area is Muğla Province – covering Fethiye, Marmaris, Bodrum – which has gorgeous Aegean coast landscapes. These are more touristic towns, but an increasing number of foreigners live year-round. Bodrum in particular has some private English schools and a sizable expat scene (it’s somewhat upscale, popular with European retirees and Turks from big cities who moved remote). Istanbul, while a vibrant city with job opportunities, is very crowded and perhaps not “calm, nature-friendly” in the sense the family wants – although one could live in the green outskirts or on the Princes’ Islands to mitigate that.

  

Residency: Turkey is known for its relatively easy residency process. Many foreigners obtain a short-term residence permit (up to 2 years renewable) by renting or buying property. There isn’t a strict income requirement codified; you just need to show you have the means to support yourself (often an affidavit or showing some savings). Given $5k/month income, that’s more than sufficient financially. Do note that in 2022–2023, Turkey started being more strict about issuing residence permits to those who just continuously live on tourist visas – they prefer if you either rent long-term or buy property to demonstrate commitment. Buying real estate ≥ $75,000 in certain cities (like Antalya) can make it even easier to get approved. Residency allows the spouse and children to be included as dependents as well.

  

For work: If the father wanted to join a Turkish company, he’d need a work permit. It’s doable if a company sponsors him, but Turkish salaries in IT might be much lower than his remote income (though cost of living is lower too). Some foreign companies operate in Turkey (esp. in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir tech parks). English-speaking roles exist, but knowledge of Turkish would open more doors. One potential scenario is freelancing or starting a company in Turkey – foreigners can establish a business and then get a work permit as the company manager (this involves some capital and hiring a few Turkish employees within a year to meet requirements). But if remote work suffices, staying on a family residence permit is simplest.

  

Cost of Living: Turkey’s cost of living is dramatically lower than the EU, especially with the current exchange rates. As cited, around $2,000/month sustains a family of four in a city like Antalya comfortably  . To put it in perspective, groceries, utilities, and domestic services are cheap (many expat families hire part-time house help or nannies because wages are affordable). Eating out is inexpensive – Turkish cuisine is delicious and accessible. Imported goods (like certain international school tuition or imported products) can be pricey though. Inflation in Turkey has been high, so prices do change, but for someone with income in USD, it’s advantageous.

  

Education: International schooling is available primarily in Istanbul and Ankara. Antalya has a few international schools/colleges – for instance, there’s an International Community School in Antalya (with instruction in English) . There are also private schools that follow the Turkish curriculum but teach bilingually and cater to foreign students (some have IB programs). Since Antalya has a notable Russian expat population, there are even schools following the Russian curriculum. If you were to live in a smaller town on the coast, you might have to commute your kids to the nearest city for school, or eventually consider boarding school options for higher grades. Homeschooling is not officially recognized in Turkey, but some expat families do it under the radar for flexibility.

  

If considering Istanbul: it has the widest array of international schools (British, American, French, German, etc., and even a Japanese school). But Istanbul’s lifestyle is the opposite of “calm nature” – though it has lovely areas and the Bosphorus shores, traffic and crowds are issues.

  

Healthcare: Turkey’s healthcare system is quite robust – it’s actually a medical tourism destination for many. As residents, you can join the government health insurance (SGK) by paying premiums, or use private health insurance (which for a family can be a few hundred dollars a year for local plans). There are modern private hospitals especially in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, but also in coastal cities like Antalya. Quality of care is generally high and costs are much lower than Western Europe or the US (e.g. a private doctor visit ~$30 as noted ). Many doctors speak English or German (Turkey has many German-educated doctors).

  

Family life: Turkish culture, like the others, is extremely family-oriented. Children are cherished, and you will often see multi-generational families out together. In coastal areas, kids grow up with a lot of freedom to play outside, and activities like swimming are part of daily life in summer. Safety is reasonable – petty crime in tourist zones exists, but violent crime is uncommon in residential areas. One consideration: as a secular Muslim-majority country, Turkey has a blend of lifestyles – coastal and big city areas are very liberal, whereas some interior regions are more conservative. As foreigners, you are free to live as you like; just be culturally respectful (which mainly means, for example, in very conservative villages one might dress modestly, but in tourist/resort areas this is a non-issue). The family might enjoy Turkey’s rich cultural heritage – ancient ruins, festivals, etc., similar to Greece.

  

Residency to Citizenship: Turkey allows those residing on work permits to apply for citizenship after 5 years (with language knowledge). Time on short-term tourist residence permits typically doesn’t count towards citizenship, but one can transition to a longer-term status. Many Russians and others simply maintain their renewable residence and perhaps invest in property, and if desired, Turkey’s citizenship-by-investment (CBI) is one of the most straightforward (buy $400k in real estate and you can get a passport in a few months). The Turkish passport isn’t as powerful as EU ones, but it does allow visa-free travel to many countries and might be a strategic option if one wants to add a citizenship without renouncing current ones (Turkey recognizes dual citizenship).

  

In essence, Turkey – particularly the Antalya region – offers a sunny, relaxed, and affordable lifestyle with enough expat infrastructure to feel comfortable. It’s a place where your budget will go far: you could potentially afford a larger home with a pool or garden, and enjoy a lot of outdoor activities year-round. The trade-offs are the need to navigate a different language (Turkish, which uses a Latin alphabet and is logical but will take effort to learn) and a different bureaucracy. Given the family already has experience in Indonesia, adapting to Turkey might be relatively smooth (Turkey is in many ways more developed infrastructure-wise than Indonesia).

  

Georgia 🇬🇪

  

Georgia is a smaller and somewhat offbeat choice, but it has emerged as a haven for many digital nomads and expats seeking a mix of European and Asian lifestyle at low cost. It borders Russia (and Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan) and sits at the crossroads of East and West culturally. For a Russian/Uzbek family, Georgia can feel more familiar culturally (widespread Russian language knowledge, Soviet-influenced infrastructure) yet also offers a unique Caucasus flair.

  

Environment & Lifestyle: Georgia is famed for its Caucasus mountains, wine country, and Black Sea coast. Tbilisi, the capital, is the likely place to base because it has the best schools and hospitals. Tbilisi is a charming city with a blend of old architecture and a growing modern scene. It’s not too large (about 1 million people) and has a somewhat bohemian, relaxed vibe in parts of the city. Nature is always close – you see hills around the city, and ski resorts and hiking trails are just 1-2 hours drive. The city has become quite international since 2022, with many expats from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Europe, etc. moving there (so you’ll find expat kids’ playgroups, international restaurants, etc.). Batumi, on the Black Sea, is another city some remote workers like (a smaller “resort city” known for casinos and beachfront living). Batumi has some international school options and a sizable foreign community too, though it’s more seasonal (buzzing in summer, quieter in winter).

  

Visa & Residency: Georgia has one of the world’s most lenient visa policies – many nationalities (including Russians and Uzbeks) can stay 365 days visa-free . Essentially, you could just arrive in Georgia as a tourist and legally stay for up to a year without doing anything. Many expats simply do a quick border run at the end of a year to reset the clock (e.g. a weekend trip to Turkey or Armenia, then re-enter for a new year). This means you don’t even need a formal residence permit initially to live there. If you want a more official status, you can get a Temporary Residence Permit by one of several ways: work contract (if a local company hires you), business (if you register a Georgian LLC or as a sole proprietor and show some activity), or property purchase (buy real estate above a certain modest threshold, currently $100k, and you qualify for residence).

  

Given the father’s remote work, one approach some use is to register as an Individual Entrepreneur (IE) in Georgia – Georgia offers a favorable tax status called “Small Business Status” where if your annual revenue is under ~₾500k (Georgian Lari, about $180k), you pay just 1% tax on revenue (up to a certain point). Many foreign freelancers do this to officially invoice through Georgia and pay very low tax. The IE registration could support a residence permit application on the basis of doing business. However, because the 1-year visa-free is so convenient, you might not need a permit until you approach 6 years (because for citizenship or permanent residence, you’d want documented residency).

  

Cost of Living: Extremely low by European standards. Rents in Tbilisi for a modern 3-bedroom in the city center might be $800, while in suburbs maybe $500. Groceries and eating out are cheap; local fresh produce is abundant. We saw estimates ~$2,000 excluding rent , which might translate to maybe $2,500 including a nice rent, per month. Utilities are cheap too. The family will enjoy that $5k goes a long way – likely you can save money while living in Georgia.

  

Education: The limited number of international schools in Tbilisi (around 16)  is enough for most needs. The most popular among expats are QSI International School (American-style), the British International School, and some newer ones. There are also some Russian-language schools (holdovers from Soviet times), but you might prefer an English environment for broader opportunities. Classes might be smaller and facilities not as lavish as in wealthier countries, but they cover the basics well. If the children are to eventually enter European universities, an IB school in Tbilisi could be a path.

  

Healthcare: Healthcare in Georgia is a mixed bag. There are private clinics in Tbilisi that are decent for routine care (and very affordable). For serious conditions, many expats consider flying to Turkey or elsewhere if they can, because Georgian hospitals may not yet be at Western European level for complex surgeries, etc. However, for typical pediatric care, dentistry, etc., you’ll find competent doctors in Tbilisi (often Georgian doctors speak Russian, some speak English, especially the younger generation). It’s recommended to have private health insurance that covers medical evacuation, just in case. That said, the air quality in Tbilisi can be a bit poor in winter (from cars and some heating methods) – something to be aware of for child health.

  

Culture & Language: Georgians are known for their hospitality. It’s a very family-centric culture as well. The concept of the supra (feast) with family and friends is central – as newcomers, you might be invited to big meals and treated almost like family friends quickly. The Georgian language is unique and not widely spoken outside Georgia, but Russian is the common second language for older Georgians and still used in many contexts, so your family’s Russian background will actually be a big asset for daily life – you can communicate without Georgian in many places. Younger Georgians increasingly speak English (Tbilisi has a vibrant young creative scene where English is common). So, you could get by with Russian and English just fine, while perhaps picking up some Georgian pleasantries to integrate better.

  

Nature: If you love mountains, Georgia is paradise. You can do weekend trips to places like Kazbegi (Stepantsminda) for incredible mountain vistas, or to Kakheti for winery tours among rolling vineyards. The Black Sea beaches (Batumi, Kobuleti) are fun in summer (though the beaches are pebbly). There are also many lakes and rivers. It’s an outdoorsy family’s dream – hiking, skiing (Gudauri and Bakuriani ski resorts are family-friendly and much cheaper than Alps), horse riding, etc., all available. And unlike tropical nature, here you get four seasons – snowy winters in the mountains, but Tbilisi winters are moderate (a bit cold, some snow occasionally).

  

Residency Path: If you plan to stay long, note that to apply for permanent residency you need to have lived in Georgia for 6 years (or immediately if you invest a large sum). For citizenship, the standard is also 10 years of residence , but interestingly, Georgia’s President can grant citizenship by exception to foreigners for special contributions – some expats have received citizenship earlier due to business or other reasons. But normally, assume 10 years and a Georgian language test. Georgia technically doesn’t allow dual citizenship, but in practice they have been allowing dual citizenship more often recently by those presidential decrees. Given Georgia’s geopolitical situation, having Georgian citizenship might not be as high-value as an EU one, but it’s something to consider if you stay very long. Many use Georgia as a base for a few years and then move on or return to EU – but some fall in love with it and stay.

  

In conclusion, Georgia offers a soft landing for expats – minimal paperwork to live there, a community of like-minded remote workers, and a family-friendly culture. It’s the kind of place where your kids could roam relatively freely, enjoy nature, and you wouldn’t break the bank. The main caution is to ensure that the quality of services (schools, healthcare) meets your expectations, which is why sticking to Tbilisi or maybe Batumi is advisable.

  

Malaysia 🇲🇾

  

Moving to Asia, Malaysia stands out as an excellent family destination thanks to its modern infrastructure, widespread English use, and natural beauty. Malaysia often ranks highly in expat surveys for ease of settling in and cost of living. Culturally, it’s a diverse country (Malay, Chinese, Indian communities and many expats), which means your family would get a rich cultural exposure but also find it easy to communicate (English is an official language in education and widely spoken).

  

Regions & Lifestyle: The family might enjoy Penang Island – it’s known as a quieter, culturally rich place with beaches and green hills. The main city, George Town, is mid-sized and laid-back; Penang also has international schools and a decent expat contingent. It’s by the ocean (though beaches on Penang aren’t as pristine as some islands, but still nice) and has the convenience of city amenities. Kuala Lumpur (KL) is the capital – very urban and bustling, but with suburbs that are leafy. KL has everything – huge malls, theme parks, and you can drive to mountain retreats (Genting Highlands, Cameron Highlands) or the beach (Port Dickson) in 1-2 hours. If KL is too city-ish, Johor Bahru in the south might interest you: it’s across the border from Singapore. Many expats live in Johor’s quieter, greener communities (like Iskandar Puteri area) and enjoy access to Singapore’s economy while living in cheaper Malaysia. Borneo (East Malaysia) – states of Sabah and Sarawak – are more off the beaten path, but incredibly nature-rich (rainforests, dive sites). They have some international schools in cities like Kota Kinabalu or Kuching, but healthcare and connectivity are not as developed as Peninsular Malaysia.

  

Visa Options: Malaysia’s DE Rantau Nomad Pass is relatively new and fits remote workers well, with a low $2k income bar . It’s only 12 months though (renewable once). If planning for many years, some consider Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) – this program was revamped with high financial requirements (for Peninsular Malaysia, one needs roughly $300k in liquid assets and $10k monthly income, or for Sarawak a bit less). MM2H grants a 5-10 year residency and allows multiple entry, but it’s effectively for wealthy retirees or semi-retirees. There’s also a new Premium Visa Program (PVIP) requiring $240k bank deposit and $12k monthly income – not applicable here due to high bar. Given the father’s income, the nomad pass or possibly a standard work visa (if he found a job) are the realistic routes. However, note Malaysia imposes work visa quotas and usually requires an employer sponsor – as a foreigner you typically need a job with salary > MYR 10,000 (~$2,300) to qualify for an expat work permit, which he does have income-wise, but he’d need a local company to hire him which might not be necessary if he keeps his remote job.

  

One advantage: For up to 90 days, many nationals (including presumably Uzbeks via tourist visa on arrival, and Russians get 30 days visa-free) can stay; some people do visa runs to Thailand or Singapore. But since you want long-term stability with kids, it’s better to have a proper long-term pass.

  

Cost of Living: As shown, Malaysia’s cost is roughly half of Spain’s . For $5k, the family would live very comfortably – likely you’d spend closer to $3k and save the rest. Housing is a big bargain: you can rent a modern condo with pool, gym, security in a good area for under $1k (in Penang maybe $600, in KL $800-$1200 depending on luxury). Food is cheap – hawker stalls and local eateries offer delicious meals for a few dollars. International groceries or alcohol are pricier (Malaysia has sin taxes on alcohol). Cars are expensive due to import taxes, but Grab (ride-hailing) is cheap and public transit in cities is improving (KL has trains, Penang has buses). Many expat families also hire a part-time nanny or maid, which is affordable (often live-in domestic helpers from Philippines/Indonesia can be hired for ~$500/month).

  

Education: Malaysia shines here – lots of expats with kids mean lots of international schools. In KL, you have some of Asia’s top international schools (International School of Kuala Lumpur, Alice Smith, Garden International, etc.). These have IB or American/British curriculums and excellent facilities. Penang has Uplands International School, Tenby International, among others, which are well-regarded. The fees are lower than international schools in Europe or Singapore (still a few thousand USD per term, but value is good). If you base in Johor, you even have options like Marlborough College Malaysia (a branch of a famous UK school). So education quality would not be an issue – if anything, there are so many choices you’d find a good fit. For university, if you stayed until kids are grown, Malaysia has some international branch campuses (Nottingham University Malaysia, Monash Malaysia, etc.) and local universities are decent, plus many Malaysian grads go to UK/Aus anyway.

  

Healthcare: Malaysia’s healthcare is excellent – many doctors are Western-trained, facilities are modern (especially in private hospitals in KL, Penang, Malacca, etc.), and costs are a fraction of Western ones. It ranked #80 in the world on one index for system performance  . As a foreigner you’d use mostly private hospitals – but they are affordable (e.g. $20 for a GP visit). Health insurance can be purchased locally or you can pay out of pocket, as even major surgeries might cost only a few thousand USD. Importantly, it’s a hub for medical tourism, meaning English-speaking staff and patient-friendly service.

  

Safety & Culture: Malaysia is very safe. Violent crime is rare; you do take normal city precautions (petty theft in some areas). Politically it’s stable, though being a multi-ethnic society there are some complexities (the Malay Muslim majority and the Chinese/Indian minorities – but as expats you are somewhat outside that fray, just respect local customs). The country is majority Muslim, but a moderate form – alcohol is available (except in some states) and you can wear normal Western attire in cities (modest dress is expected when visiting government offices or rural villages). English being widespread makes daily life easy – you can enroll kids in local activities, talk to neighbors, etc., without a language barrier.

  

Nature: From an nature perspective, Malaysia is hard to beat in variety: beaches (Langkawi, Perhentian islands with world-class beaches), rainforests (Taman Negara, Borneo jungles to see orangutans), mountains (Mount Kinabalu in Sabah), plus all the weekend getaway options (short flight to Thailand, Bali, etc.). Within Penang or KL, you have pockets of nature (Penang Hill, KL Forest Eco Park) and lots of weekend trip options.

  

Residency Path: As discussed, Malaysia is more of a long-term residency place rather than a citizenship destination (since citizenship would require giving up current nationalities, which is a big step and not usually necessary). You could potentially renew the digital nomad pass or switch to MM2H to keep staying. Some expats who love Malaysia maintain a MM2H for decades. PR is very hard unless one spouse is Malaysian or via a direct application after many years (e.g. some who work 5+ years on an Employment Pass try to apply for PR, but it’s not a transparent points system as in Canada/Aus – it’s at government discretion and usually limited). So you’d treat it as “we can stay as long as it works for us, but we’re not going to easily become Malaysian” – which is fine if the goal is a decade of good life and then maybe onward or back home by the time kids hit college.

  

In summary, Malaysia offers a convenient, friendly, and adventure-filled life. It’s somewhat underrated compared to say Singapore or Thailand, but it really combines the best of both: It has a high standard of living and English usage like Singapore (but much cheaper and more spacious), and it has tropical charm and a relaxed feel like Thailand (but more orderly and with better education options). If the family enjoys warm climates and doesn’t mind occasional tropical downpours, Malaysia could be an ideal new home.

  

Thailand 🇹🇭

  

Thailand is another Asian favorite for expat families and digital nomads. It offers an exotic culture, low costs, and a famous friendly vibe. The family likely has some familiarity with Thailand given its proximity to Indonesia – and indeed many who start in Bali or KL often gravitate to Thailand for a change, or vice versa.

  

Environment & Lifestyle: For calmer living, Chiang Mai in northern Thailand is often mentioned. It’s a mid-sized city in the foothills of mountains, known as a global digital nomad hotspot. It’s more mountain nature (waterfalls, elephants, trekking) than beaches (no beach, since it’s inland). Chiang Mai has numerous cafes, a laid-back old town, and a large community of expats and their families. International schools exist and cost less than in Bangkok. Another choice: Phuket, an island with beautiful beaches, also has a sizable expat population and multiple international schools (due to many foreigners in the marine and hospitality industries). Phuket is more touristic, but if you live there long-term you find the quieter corners. Koh Samui is a smaller island – very tranquil and lovely, but only one or two international schools (you’d have to verify their quality). Bangkok is one of Asia’s largest cities – exciting but congested. Some expats with families live in the greener suburban districts or even in beach towns like Hua Hin (3 hours from Bangkok) and occasionally commute or have a parent stay in Bangkok for work on weekdays.

  

Thailand’s advantage is you can tailor the environment: mountains (Chiang Mai), city (Bangkok), or beach (Phuket, Koh Samui, Hua Hin, etc.). The Thai people are famously warm and smiley – it’s called Land of Smiles for a reason. Children are doted on, and foreigners are generally welcomed kindly.

  

Visa Options: Historically, Thailand was tricky for long-term visas unless you were a retiree or had a job. But recently the Long-Term Resident (LTR) visa program was introduced. One category targets remote professionals, but its income requirement ($80k/year) is a bit high . If the father has a degree in certain fields and 5+ years experience, they allow $40k/yr – he might be at ~$60k which is between, so not sure if they’d flex. Another is the Thailand Elite visa, which is essentially buying membership for staying: e.g. a 5-year elite visa at 600,000 THB ($17k). That’s expensive upfront, but some expats do it for the ease (no income proof needed, just money).

  

However, in late 2023 Thailand also approved a 6-month to 1-year Digital Nomad Visa under their SMART Visa program (often referred as SMART “Visa Type E” or a special Tourist Visa extension). It’s not fully clear at this time of writing, but likely they will formalize something allowing at least 12 months for remote workers with moderate income (similar to Malaysia’s maybe). For now, many nomads use successive tourist visas or “education visas” (enrolling in Thai language classes) to stay – not ideal for a family with kids in school, since kids need an ED visa for their school anyway (which they can get if enrolled in a Thai school).

  

If the father finds a local job (some international schools or companies might hire foreign talent), a work permit (Non-Immigrant B visa + Work Permit) can be obtained. The process can be bureaucratic and Thai companies have foreigner quotas, but in tech fields they do hire expats especially in Bangkok or some in Chiang Mai’s growing tech scene.

  

Cost of Living: Even Bangkok is cheaper than Western cities – and places like Chiang Mai are much cheaper. For instance, in Chiang Mai, a family could rent a 3BR house with a yard for $800, have a maid weekly, a car, and still be under perhaps $2,500/month total expenses. In Bangkok, housing in expat-oriented areas (Sukhumvit) can be pricey ($1500+ for family apartments), but daily expenses like food, transport are cheap (skytrain tickets $1, street food meal $2). Thailand also ranked well for expat Quality of Life, particularly leisure options  – meaning you won’t be bored: night markets, amazing food, weekend island trips etc. Indeed, “life filled with lively night markets, temple visits, and weekend trips to islands” is a realistic depiction  .

  

Education: Bangkok has probably 100+ international schools – including some of the best British and American schools in Asia. Chiang Mai has a handful of good ones (e.g. Chiang Mai International School, and others catering to various faiths or pedagogies, even a Waldorf school). Phuket has a few (British International School Phuket is well-known). One thing: international school fees in Thailand can be significant (not as high as in Singapore or HK, but still one of the bigger expenses). If the remote income is fixed at $5k, budgeting for two kids’ tuition is something to plan (some schools might be $10k per year per child or more at higher grades, though there are cheaper ones). Alternatively, some expat families use Thai private bilingual schools which are cheaper but still have some English – an option if wanting to integrate more and spend less.

  

Healthcare: Thailand’s healthcare is excellent in the private sector. Bangkok’s top hospitals (Bumrungrad, BNH, Samitivej, etc.) are internationally accredited and cater to expats/medical tourists. In Chiang Mai and Phuket, there are also private hospitals with high standards. Costs are higher than Malaysia but still much less than the West (e.g. an MRI for a few hundred dollars, a specialist consult for $30-50). Many doctors were trained abroad. Public hospitals are crowded and mainly for locals, but in an emergency they are competent (just maybe nobody speaks English well). It’s wise to have insurance to use the private system.

  

Safety & Culture: Thailand is generally safe. The main concern sometimes is road safety – traffic accidents rates are high, so one has to be careful on scooters (common mode of transport) or hire drivers until comfortable. Crime against foreigners is rare; Thailand relies on tourism so heavily that authorities keep serious crime low in tourist areas. Politically, Thailand has had upheavals (coups) in past decades, but these rarely affect day-to-day life of expats beyond some protests in Bangkok occasionally.

  

The culture is Buddhist and emphasizes respect, calm, and saving face. It meshes well with a peaceful family life; your children might partake in school celebrations of Loy Krathong (floating lantern festival) or Songkran (water festival) – great cultural experiences.

  

Residency & Citizenship: Long-term in Thailand usually means either renewing visas (Elite or LTR) or eventually aiming for Permanent Residence (PR). Earning PR in Thailand requires 3+ years of work permits and meeting an annual quota per nationality, plus Thai language basics. It’s competitive and few achieve it. Citizenship after PR is another few years and a language test + interview in Thai – quite difficult (though some long-term expats do it, and dual citizenship is unofficially tolerated despite some ambiguous laws). So like Malaysia, Thailand is more a place you enjoy living for years without necessarily becoming a citizen.

  

In summary, if the family prizes a relaxed lifestyle with rich cultural experiences and natural beauty, and doesn’t mind working within a somewhat fluid visa system, Thailand could be fantastic. Many expat kids grow up very happily in Thailand – it can be a very fun place to be a child (zoo trips, elephant sanctuaries, weekend beach outings, etc., are things childhood memories are made of). The key is sorting out the visa – possibly by investing in the Elite visa or hoping the new nomad visa is accessible – and ensuring the kids’ schooling is set. With that, Thailand offers arguably one of the best quality-of-life for cost ratios in the world.

  

United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪

  

The UAE (particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi) is in a different category – an ultra-modern, highly developed environment. It’s a top choice for many expat families due to its safety, high standard of schooling and healthcare, and career opportunities. The climate is desert (very hot summers, pleasant winters). While it might not have lush green nature, it has well-planned communities with parks, and the ocean (Persian Gulf) with beautiful beaches and lots of water activities for kids.

  

Lifestyle: Dubai is like a polished megacity that’s very internationally oriented – about 85% of residents are foreigners. English is the lingua franca. You can find communities to plug into whether you speak English, Russian, or others (there is a significant Russian-speaking community in Dubai as well). It is urban, but there are calmer residential areas (for instance, many families live in villa communities on the outskirts or in smaller emirates and enjoy a quieter life). If “calm” is the goal, one could consider Abu Dhabi (the capital, slightly quieter and more traditional than flashy Dubai), or Ras Al Khaimah (the northern emirate, more laid-back with mountains and beach, actively promoting itself for remote workers).

  

However, note that nature in the UAE is mostly desert landscapes. There are mountains in Ras Al Khaimah and Hatta (and one can go hiking or mountain biking), and beaches everywhere, but no forests or big lakes. Still, if the family likes beach and outdoor sports, they’ll enjoy it. Plus, Dubai creates a lot of artificial green spaces (big parks, an indoor ski slope, etc. – virtually everything can be found or built).

  

Visa Options: The Dubai Remote Work Visa could be a straightforward initial route – requiring $5k monthly income , which the father has exactly. It’s a 1-year visa; you’d renew each year by showing continued employment. It allows the family to live in Dubai and the kids to attend school (you sponsor them under your visa). This program was introduced in 2020 to attract remote professionals. Another route if eligible could be the UAE Golden Visa: for instance, if the father had extraordinary achievements or a high salary contract in UAE, or if you invest in property (~AED 2 million = ~$545k, not sure if in budget). Golden Visa would give 10-year residency. But realistically, the remote work visa is the simplest given his situation.

  

Employment: Dubai has a booming tech and design sector. Big tech firms and countless startups operate there, so if the father ever wanted to transition to a local job, opportunities exist. Salaries in Dubai for experienced product designers could even exceed his current income, and there’s no income tax (0%). The workweek and environment are quite modern (though expect a Sunday-Thursday workweek as Friday is holy day, though UAE recently moved to a mid-Friday weekend alignment partially). The possibility of a local job is certainly there, which could then lead to a company-sponsored visa or even a long-term visa if he qualifies as a highly skilled worker.

  

Cost of Living: This is where UAE differs – it’s expensive, especially schooling and housing. We estimated needing ~$4k or more per month. Indeed, housing is the big one: a typical 3-bedroom villa or apartment in a nice family area (with pool, gym, etc.) could be $3,000/month in Dubai. You can find cheaper in Sharjah or further out, but then you commute. Groceries can be costly if buying imported items. However, cars and petrol are cheaper than in Europe, and electronics are tax-free so sometimes cheaper. Also, salaries often are higher to compensate. Since you have $5k fixed, you’d have to budget carefully in the UAE. Many expat families have dual incomes or housing allowances from employers to afford the lifestyle. But since you’re remote, you’d be paying everything yourself. One strategy: consider living in a cheaper emirate like Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) or Ajman where rent is lower and life more slow-paced, and drive into Dubai occasionally for big shopping or entertainment. RAK has some nomad visa initiative (they launched a “RAK Digital Nomad Visa” in 2022 in partnership with a coworking firm, but it’s essentially the same federal remote work visa but marketed for RAK). In RAK, you get the backdrop of the Hajar Mountains and a quieter life; it’s an hour from Dubai.

  

Education: The UAE’s private international schools are abundant. British-curriculum schools (GCSE/A-level) are most common, but American and IB schools exist too. The quality ranges from decent to world-class; some schools have ultra-modern facilities (robotics labs, etc.). The main concern is the fees – top schools in Dubai can charge $15k–$25k per year per child. There are more affordable ones (maybe $8k/year), often newer or less “premium” schools. With two kids, schooling could easily be your largest expense, potentially up to half your income if not careful. However, because your kids are still very young, kindergarten fees might be lower, and you can plan ahead for primary. There are also some Russian curriculum schools in UAE given the recent influx of Russians (for example, in Dubai there’s a Russian International School).

  

Healthcare: Very high quality but also high cost. Residents are required to have health insurance. Many employers provide it, but in your case you’d have to buy family coverage. Ensure the plan covers maternity (if you plan more kids) and good pediatric coverage. Dubai’s hospitals like Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi or Mediclinic are superb. Simple clinic visits might be $100 if paying cash, but insurance would cover a lot after copays. With insurance, the healthcare experience is as good as in the West (if not better in terms of service).

  

Safety & Family Life: The UAE is extremely safe – crime is very low. You can leave a stroller outside a shop and it’ll be there when you return, that kind of safe. The government is stable and quite forward-thinking (they invest heavily in technology, education, and making expat life attractive). As an Islamic country, it does have cultural norms (e.g. modest dress in public places – though in Dubai and resorts, you’ll see everything; it’s very liberal by regional standards). They have made legal changes to accommodate expats (allowing non-Muslims to purchase alcohol with a license, cohabitation now legal, etc.). For children, there are endless activities – from water parks, indoor play zones, desert camping, to sports leagues. The city is designed to entertain and cater to families. The downside is, some feel the “culture” is a bit artificial or consumeristic – lots of malls, etc., and not as much historical culture as Europe or Asia. But one can find community through schools or interest groups.

  

Residency/Citizenship: The mindset should be that UAE is a long-term stint, not a permanent migration. Unless something changes, you won’t get a UAE passport (and if you did, you’d have to renounce others; plus it’s near impossible except for maybe your infant if they grew up there could maybe get Emirati citizenship if the country changes policies in future – but not in current law). So you’d be maintaining your own passports. The UAE now allows 10-year and even 5-year self-sponsored visas (Golden Visa, Green Visa) for certain categories, which essentially function like PR (no need for employer, can sponsor family). If you end up investing or the father gets recognized as an expert (for example, there’s a Talent Pass or you could set up a free zone company and get a visa for 3 years easily), those could give more stability than annual renewal.

  

In conclusion, the UAE is ideal if you want a plush, safe life with top-notch services and don’t mind an urban desert setting. It’s more expensive and less organically “nature” than other options, but it has beaches and lots of man-made recreation instead. It could be a good fit if schooling quality is a top priority and you want an English/Russian speaking environment with minimal culture shock – but financially, you’d need to budget for high expenses or plan to increase income over time (maybe the father can freelance or take additional gigs, since no income tax means any extra earnings he makes are take-home). Many families love it there for the convenience and the fact that it’s very easy living (everything can be home-delivered, domestic help is common, etc., making parenting a bit easier).

  

Australia & New Zealand 🇦🇺🇳🇿

  

(We combine these since they are similar in lifestyle, though each has unique aspects.)

  

For a family that loves nature, English-speaking society, and a path to citizenship, Australia or New Zealand would be the dream – if they can get in. Both countries consistently rank high for quality of life, safety, and education. They have plenty of ocean, mountains, lakes – you name it. The catch is the visa: one typically needs to qualify under a skilled migration program or find a job.

  

Australia: If the father is under 45 and has a degree/experience, he might try for the Skilled Independent Visa (points-based). Product Designer might not be an obvious occupation on the skilled list, but perhaps if framed as an “ICT Business Analyst” or “Multimedia Designer” or something, it could fit. It may require taking an English test and getting skills assessed. Alternatively, one could go on a student visa (e.g. father does a 2-year master’s in Australia – during which spouse can work limited hours and kids can attend school as dependents). After graduation he’d get a post-study work visa and possibly PR. That’s a longer path and costly tuition-wise, but some do it as a PR strategy.

  

However, if the father can secure a job offer from an Australian company, a sponsor visa (482 TSS) could be simpler – this requires the employer to prove no local readily fills the role and pay a certain salary (for tech jobs often above ~AUD 70k). If he’s in UX/UI design, maybe companies in Sydney/Melbourne would hire him for that amount or more. The family would then get visas as well. After 3 years, the employer can nominate for PR or he can apply under a skilled category.

  

Life in Australia would tick all boxes: infrastructure is first-rate, schools are free public (and excellent quality globally) or numerous private options, healthcare via Medicare for PRs means mostly free medical treatment. Australians are generally very welcoming and it’s a multicultural society (especially cities). There are sizeable expat communities from all over (and specifically some Russians/central Asians in cities, though not as many as in Turkey or Dubai, say).

  

For calm life with nature, one might choose cities like Perth (on the Indian Ocean, isolated, very relaxed pace, lots of nature around), Adelaide (smaller city with beaches and wine country around), or even Hobart in Tasmania (very small city, pristine nature). Sydney and Melbourne are big and can be busy, but even they have quiet family suburbs. Queensland (Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast) offers a subtropical climate and beachy lifestyle with growing job markets – might be a sweet spot between city and nature.

  

New Zealand: NZ is smaller population (~5 million) and the immigration system is points-based as well. The skills list is slightly different. If the father could manage to get a job offer in NZ, that practically guarantees enough points for residency under the Skilled Migrant Category (NZ currently even grants straight-to-residence for some roles, though product designer might not be one of them). NZ employers might be a bit more hesitant to hire from abroad, but the tech/design sector in Auckland or Wellington could be approached. Another route: Global Impact Visa (for entrepreneurs) or Residence for Investors (if one had significant funds to invest). Barring those, one might first get a Work Visa (perhaps via a job search visa, which NZ sometimes offers for those with certain qualifications).

  

Life in NZ would be idyllic for raising kids: it’s like living in a postcard with mountains, forests, and beaches all within reach. The society is very child-friendly (lots of community sports, libraries, etc.). One potential downside is that it’s far from other countries – long flights to anywhere. Also, the job market is smaller and salaries lower than Australia (cost of living is also high relative to wages, which some expats notice – but with foreign income, you’d not be affected by the wage issue).

  

Education: Both Aus & NZ have English-speaking curricula with public schools that generally outshine many international schools elsewhere. If you become a resident, your kids just enroll like locals (and these schools frequently rank well internationally in achievement). They emphasize holistic development, outdoor activities (class trips to learn bushcraft, etc.), which suits a nature-oriented upbringing. University is not free, but citizens can get student loans easily – and both countries’ citizens are welcomed in each other’s universities at local rates due to agreements.

  

Healthcare: Australia’s Medicare covers PRs/citizens (and some temporary visa holders from certain countries due to reciprocal agreements – Russia/Uzbekistan likely not included though). NZ has a similar public system. Both provide low-cost care, and emergencies are free. Private insurance is optional for shorter waits on elective surgeries, etc. With kids, the public system is usually enough (e.g. in Australia children’s hospitals are top-notch and free).

  

Community & Safety: Both countries rank extremely high on safety indexes  – virtually no violent crime in normal life (of course every place has some crime, but statistically very safe). They are also politically stable democracies. Culturally, they are Western but with their own quirks – Australians are very sporty and outdoorsy, Kiwis are known for their friendliness and DIY attitude. Both have significant immigrant populations, so your family wouldn’t stand out much. Racism can occur as anywhere, but generally these societies are accepting, especially of families who make an effort to integrate.

  

Residency/Citizenship: The great advantage – once you have PR, you don’t need to worry about visas ever again. And citizenship is relatively quick (Australia 4 years, NZ 5 years of residency). Dual citizenship is allowed in both, so your family could end up with an Australian or Kiwi passport while keeping your originals (though check Russia/Uzbek rules on dual – Russia allows it but requires notification).

  

Given all these positives, the main challenge is gaining entry. It would require some paperwork and perhaps time (maybe apply in 2025 and get a visa by 2026 for example). If you’re not in a rush and willing to go through that process, it could absolutely pay off in the long term, granting the children a world of opportunities as they grow. In the meantime, one might consider living somewhere like Malaysia or Georgia (easy entry) while trying for Australia/NZ immigration, as a strategy.

  

Conclusion

  

In choosing among these options, the family should weigh factors such as ease of obtaining the visa, the day-to-day living costs, and how well the environment matches their ideal lifestyle. For instance, Europe (Spain, Portugal, Greece) offers cultural richness and a pathway to an EU citizenship, but the trade-off is dealing with higher costs and some bureaucracy. Asia (Malaysia, Thailand) offers low costs and vibrant cultures, but long-term security (PR status) is less straightforward and it’s farther from Europe. Oceania (Australia/NZ) arguably provides the best long-term stability and environment for raising kids, but it’s the hardest to initially get into.

  

Given the family’s profile (remote income, Russian/Uzbek background, currently in Bali), a phased approach could be considered: perhaps start with a digital nomad visa in a friendly, affordable country (like Malaysia or Georgia) to enjoy a comfortable life immediately, while exploring or applying for more permanent options (like Portugal’s 5-year citizenship path or Australia’s skilled migration).

  

No matter which country they choose, it’s clear that numerous welcoming destinations around the world are open to a family with stable remote income and an adventurous spirit. Each of the countries profiled can offer a calm, nature-surrounded upbringing for the children, quality education, and a community in which the family can thrive. It will ultimately come down to the family’s priorities – be it obtaining a new nationality, maximizing savings, being close to a certain region, or immersing in a particular culture.

  

The good news is that with careful planning, the family can make a smooth transition from Indonesia to a new long-term home, and enjoy the benefits of their global mobility. The world is more accommodating than ever to digital nomads and international families, so they have the privilege of choice. By considering the information above and perhaps visiting some top contenders, they can find the perfect next country to call home for the coming years.
