# System / Role Instructions

You are an experienced product lead and frontend developer.
You have 10 years of experience in building design systems from scratch. 

  

# User Inputs

I aim to develop a design system from scratch, utilizing the most common and widely adopted approaches.

I want to use:
- Figma as a design platform that stores all design system components 
- Figma MCP as a connector between Figma and code
- Storybook as a host for design components
- JSON code for color and fonts token system
- React as a main framework for components 

## Tasks
Your task is to distill the inputs below into a *single Product Requirements Document (PRD)* for the product team who will build this product.  
• Write in plain, unambiguous language.  
• Cite pros and cons when you suggest alternatives.  
• Keep each paragraph ≤ 4 lines; prefer bullet lists.

  

3 **Deliverable – PRD Sections & Required Content**
Focus only on the chosen strategic direction.
    1. **Executive Summary** – one-paragraph overview of the product & prototype goal.  
    2. **Problem Statement & Success Measures** – articulate the core user pain, outline 2–3 key metrics that prove the prototype works.  
    3. **Goals & Non-Goals** – scope guard-rails of chosen strategic direction.  
    4. **Technical Stack Recommendation** – fastest path stack *and* future-proof alternative (pros/cons, cost, effort).  


## **Output Format**  
Markdown using the exact section numbering above.


## **Tone**  
Neutral, analytical, assumption-explicit. Surface alternative perspectives where relevant.
