❓ I have a question for product designers ❓
How do you understand that you’ve reached a certain grade or level in your career, such as transitioning to a senior role? 
Do you rely solely on performance reviews, or are there other ways you evaluate your growth? And what if there’s no formal performance review process? 

I’m asking because I often get questions about assessing one’s grade or level. 

So, I’m curious — do you have a similar need or interest in this topic?
Let me know your thoughts!

I always see a hidden question here: "For what?" or "Why?" Why do I need to understand my level? Here are some interesting answers:

— "I want to be paid more": Performance review is the best way to assess your level, as this process is centralized across the company and deeply integrated with finance and C&B teams.

— "I want to know where I am in the global market" or "I want to start looking for new opportunities": In this case, you can ask mentors to evaluate your level or simply apply for vacancies at the level you think you've reached. Mentors and companies will give you valuable feedback.

— "I want to work on more complex and impactful projects": Your level doesn't matter here—just tell your manager you want more responsibilities and take action.

— "I want to grow professionally": Reflect on your work and get feedback from your teammates, managers, leads, or mentors. Develop your growth plan with your manager. This inevitably leads back to the first point in this list.

There could be more answers to the "why" question, and each answer has its own tools or combinations.
