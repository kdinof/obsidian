#where-to-live

I want you to help me with a research about in what country me and my family can live for a long-term, and ideally get a residential permit. 

# More context about us
- we have the Russian and the Uzbekistan residency
- We have two kids. One of them five years old and another just born
- I officially work as a product designer at Uzbek company, and have around $ 5000 as monthly income
- My wife doesn’t work. She doesn’t has an income. 
- Now we are living in Indonesia and have KITAS here.

# Our preferences
- not urban city like New York or Moscow. We love more quiet cities but with developed infrastructure and close to the nature (mountains, lakes, sea, ocean) like Barcelona, Kuala Lumpur or Portu. 
- We aren’t considering South America. 
- Our main goal is to give our kids a height quality education. So international schools and universities are must for us
- Ideally for me work at local it company
