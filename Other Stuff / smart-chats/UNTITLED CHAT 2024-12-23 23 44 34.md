Based on your notes, here are the main thoughts you should convey to the students:

**1. Focus on Learning and Curiosity, Not Just Money and Titles:**

*   **Adulthood is about learning through trial and error.** It's a time to experiment and figure out what you're passionate about. Don't be afraid to screw up, that's how you learn.
*   **Start with "What do I want to learn?"** instead of "How much money can I make?" or "What title can I get?". Follow your curiosity, not a business school playbook.
*   **The only failure in your twenties is inaction.** The rest is trial and error. Don't be afraid to take risks and explore different paths.

**2. Seek Out "Revolutionary" Companies and Get Your Hands Dirty:**

*   **Don't just look for a job, look for a revolution.** Find companies that are creating something new, solving real problems, and have a vision you believe in.
*   **Avoid being a "management consultant" at large firms.** You might get a nice paycheck, but you won't learn how to build or run a company. You need to actually *do* the job to truly learn and grow.
*   **You have to care about every step, lovingly craft every detail.** Be there when things fall apart so you can put them back together.

**3. Prioritize Working with Your "Heroes":**

*   **The people you work with are the most important factor in a job.** Focus on connecting with the best people in your field, the ones you truly respect.
*   **Don't just chase the big names.** Look at who reports to them and who is doing the actual work. Find the experts in your specific area of interest.
*   **Reach out to these experts.** Share your point of view, ask smart questions, and connect on your shared passions.

**4. Understand Your Impact at Different Companies:**

*   **Working at a giant company might feel like being a "pebble bouncing off an elephant."** You might be well-paid, but your impact will be limited, especially early on.
*   **Smaller, growing companies offer more opportunities for growth and impact.**

**5. Embrace the Unorthodox Path:**

*   **Human nature doesn't change.** Don't feel pressured to follow the latest trends. Focus on the timeless principles of learning, hard work, and connecting with great people.
*   **Mentors are valuable, but they won't give you all the answers.** They will help you see things from a new perspective and guide you to find your own solutions.

**In summary, your talk should encourage students to:**

*   Be curious and prioritize learning.
*   Seek out companies that are making a real difference.
*   Focus on working with people they admire and respect.
*   Be willing to get their hands dirty and learn by doing.
*   Embrace the journey of trial and error.
*   Understand that their choices are their own and they have a window to make them.
