What does “poke the bear” mean?

##### assistant
Based on your notes, the phrase "poke the bear" doesn't appear directly. However, the concept of "pushing the limits" and "bending reality" as mentioned in the "Config 2024" notes, particularly under the section about "A leader with clarity," could be interpreted as a related idea.

Here's how those concepts connect to the idea of "poking the bear":

*   **Pushing the Limits:** This suggests challenging the status quo, going beyond what's considered normal or acceptable, and exploring unconventional approaches. This is similar to the idea of "poking the bear" in that it involves taking a risk and potentially disrupting a comfortable situation.
*   **Bending Reality:** This implies a willingness to challenge assumptions and explore possibilities that others might dismiss as impossible. This can be seen as a more extreme version of "poking the bear," as it involves actively trying to change the existing order of things.

In the context of the "Config 2024" notes, these actions are framed positively as necessary for achieving a "design Golden Era" and creating a culture of excellence. They are associated with visionary leadership and a team that is willing to take risks and challenge the norm.

Therefore, while the exact phrase "poke the bear" isn't used, the notes suggest that a willingness to challenge the status quo, take risks, and push boundaries is a key element of achieving great things. This aligns with the general understanding of "poking the bear" as a deliberate act of challenging something established or powerful, with the understanding that it might lead to unexpected or even negative consequences, but also potentially to significant breakthroughs.
