## Highlights

> The problem with late-stage technical reviews is that when they happen _too late,_ like when a direction or design has already been built out, they can lead to launch-blocking feedback.

> This was the genesis of Figma’s **engineering critiques**, dedicated time for the engineering team to brainstorm novel approaches to technical problems, get feedback on existing work, and unblock each other.

> Engineering crits are explicitly _not_ an approval or decision-making meeting. They are about getting the right feedback to lift ideas up. We ask reviewers to lead with suggestions as opposed to mandates, because we want to ensure we use the time in these meetings to capture as much of the collective learnings and wisdom of the group.
