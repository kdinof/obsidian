## Highlights

> [Research ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1299209/)shows that **fear narrows our vision, thereby making us more likely to miss** the bigger picture. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#c9b91689-5eec-43eb-8c3c-ff80a987b702)  

> **behavioral economics is just the ticket for when things go south**. Between adding friction, redirecting attention, active listening, and even getting customers to convince themselves, none of these strategies relies on the obvious while some might even seem counterintuitive, but they have been proven to work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#babc8ac6-eee9-4a79-a2a0-679a92e00dc5)  

> If you ever tried to leave Amazon, for example, you’d know that the _cancel my account_ option is buried so deep into their website that you’d either need to take half a day off from work, have an MIT degree, or have Hercules Poirot at your disposal to be able to find it without getting increasingly frustrated. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#2061f0d7-3b2d-4418-a863-69a9737a6626)  

> But there’s a way around it, and that’s why **experts from MINDWORX advised Kontentino to ask instead**: _“What’s the main reason you’ve been using Kontentino so far?_ _”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#55662056-8653-4910-80b5-5e2f3234230d)  

> In short, Adobe India asked the Ogilvy team to help them increase their retention rate of customers calling to cancel their membership. The team tested out several different approaches for increasing customer retention, and the most effective one was changing the opening question that’s asked by the call center agent in a similar way that MINDWORX did. **The success rate increased by 8.8%.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#8268b225-73af-44bc-aa12-b573ee6e856d)  

> As people start coming up with reasons why they like the product, the conversation might take a different turn and even lead to a completely different outcome. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#c2d2eca3-51c1-4487-8fb1-286788a8d48f)  

> They don’t focus on what no longer works for them; instead they are asked to pay attention to what they value. And that’s when _loss aversion_ kicks in. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#8f08b818-d701-4d0b-bb15-05ddeb32243f)  

> The second advice given to Kontentino was for them to show that they, as a company, understand their customers’ situation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#6b8cf268-8555-49a7-b59d-74b0b177e271)  

> _“We all have an innate anti-persuasion system. A radar that kicks in when we sense someone is trying to convince us to do something or to think a certain way.”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#fb46fa20-38dd-4172-aab5-cf796d9d9a61)  

> As[ research ](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/36/3/337/2900261)shows, so strong is our need for agency that we prefer to make a choice, even if it makes us feel worse. And so it’s no wonder we take [countermeasures ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201/full)against being swayed. If we feel like this is happening, the simplest solution is avoidance (changing the channel, turning off a commercial, slamming the door in your mom’s face). A second, more energy-consuming strategy is counterarguing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#559d573f-96c1-4ab3-b30e-d71d84a07250)  

> We all have an innate anti-persuasion system. A radar that kicks in when we sense someone is trying to convince us to do something or to think a certain way. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#2bb9a8d3-54cc-4bca-8af7-2490eaf7354c)  

> After you’ve listened and acknowledged, it’s time to tap into Liking, one of the famous six principles of persuasion introduced by Robert Cialdini in his bestselling [book, ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006124189X/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=influenceatwork-20&linkId=96f9164a23aeda42e8b95e4adbdd5944)_Influence_: _The Psychology of Persuasion._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#59a4dc81-e4de-4423-afb4-a0c242596a13)  

> To put it briefly, the principle of Liking is an evolutionary shortcut – we are more likely to listen to people we like than those we don’t (right, mom?). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#bc586bbd-7c40-46fa-98c6-d17947a515d0)  

> If we share a common interest or feel in some ways similar to someone, **we instantly find them more likeable**. So let the customer know that you understand where they’re coming from and the two of you might even be surprised to find that you’re on the same boat. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#e82bb3b6-7d44-420a-926a-b82445cfc93d)  

> Mindworx helped tailor-make **a unique offer that would accommodate each of the target groups** and the specific dire straits that they had found themselves in (some clients had lost all their income while others weren’t hit so hard but simply wanted to save some money nonetheless). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#4024dd97-ad87-479a-85b9-3cf706884567)  

> The key was to offer two solutions customers could choose from instead of just one. This is known as an alternative of choice [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#2706775e-7d1e-4ee2-8ab2-c2dedab208af)  

> Why? Because by broadening the set of options, you help to mitigate psychological reactance, which in simplest terms means that when pushed, people push back, and that’s a barrier to change. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#fbbc90a2-b070-4193-935a-225b26056d2c)  

> If you propose just a single solution, then the only call the other party can make is to say yes or no. But if you offer more than one option to choose from, **two things will happen**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#e6e515ec-8760-481c-867e-c789618ff1e1)  

> _“Let me check if we can figure something out for your specific case…”_ Then wait a minute or two before the next response. The point is to **show** the customer that you’re making an **effort** **on their behalf** to come up with alternative solutions to their problem. So you might say something like this: [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-a-marketing-saa-s-reduced-churn-by-50-using-3-beh-18dd5ab6a68#4c9b8a4c-b972-4ce1-a977-c04f648c204b)  

> * **When your clients ask to leave, don’t ask them why**. Redirect their attention to what they like about your product or service. Instead of reconfirming their reasons for leaving, they’ll recall all the benefits they’ll lose in the event that they choose to leave.
> * **Create Liking**. Share something that makes your customer feel you have something in common and that makes you more relatable. And be genuine about it!
> * **Listen and acknowledge.** When you start to make your case, make sure to include the information your customer has shared with you. This not only makes them feel special, it also makes them believe that they’re getting a unique offer that’s tailor-made just for them. This makes the offer more valuable and, therefore, harder to refuse.
> * **Instead of just one option, offer them two options to choose from**. This will shift the dynamic from a “yes or no” to one where they have two options to compare and deliberate over.
