## Highlights

> “You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency.
> 
> Intensity impresses; consistency transforms.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-brain-food-cold-water-190fa313422#77a10efb-b833-4d80-af3c-cb1e4cc60a47)  

> “We want the outcome, but we need the journey.
> 
> A startup isn't about the money-raising headline; it's loving the grind when everyone else is out having fun. Health isn't about the gym selfie; it's the daily decision to train, even when you don't feel like it. Financial independence isn't quitting your job; it's the thousand small "nos" that let you say a big "yes" to your future.
> 
> Falling in love with outcomes doesn't move you forward. Falling in love with the process does.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fwd-brain-food-cold-water-190fa313422#a6b2c2a1-6dcb-4a3f-bd81-53443bdef8f0)
