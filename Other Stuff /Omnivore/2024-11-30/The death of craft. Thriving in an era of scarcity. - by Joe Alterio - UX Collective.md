## Highlights

> Our short time on Earth, combined with our narrow focus and influence of those closest to us, make us remarkably ill-suited for long-term planning and vision. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#b1f3ba42-5873-47d4-bb8a-875c544a3971)  

> What does it mean when a tool becomes irrelevant? For one, it means that those that are only good at that tooling are in danger. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#745df0d1-3f72-4c9d-b88f-039f96ff7947)  

> Additionally, unless the tool is open source, your focus of tooling makes you nothing more than a thane to someone else’s bottom line. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#1576c748-e093-465e-850e-465ec3ec38ab)  

> Becoming an expert in someone’s playground is at core — and I use this term judiciously — a form of _digital feudalism_. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#6d559b67-1886-47d2-9226-26eef0a61669)  

> And like any large commodified solution, those spaces have been dominated by a few large and appalling players who don’t care about art, creativity, the user, or really anything but making those fractions of pennies. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#684ec2d9-23b3-43c9-b396-5cab50b78831)  

> Those striations of labor you see above were created because as more money and more players ran into the industry, projects got more complex, more money was a stake, codebases became far more complicated, and mobile and search became things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#9ab86ce2-878e-4bca-b6d6-d2bcca056416)  

> While we can deeply mourn the loss of jobs and the disruption of the lives of millions, we need to admit that the advent of generative AI completely destroys the middleware commodification layer of UX. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#d1e88a9f-faff-40de-b360-a1ecad4999f9)  

> Every design system built in Figma, every standard pattern in a prototype, every Github ticket for a recommendation of hex color replacement can be done by a bot. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#6b5514f3-45f5-449e-898e-3f118f94befa)  

> Bot is your constantly-awake, extremely eager, probably-spinning-on-dexadrine intern. The Bot does not tire. The Bot is not bothered by your stupid syntax. The Bot doesn’t have opinions on what you order for dinner. The Bot is here, and ready to help. Forever. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#1c770337-1937-4f8f-9b13-d1ddf85bb3a5)  

> What’s more, bringing people up will be more like creative collaboration than top down management, as you bring in people that can fill in the creative gaps that you desire and like, like a true creative collective. But again, the value will be an authentic creative vision, which is actually pretty hard to do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-uxdesign-cc-the-death-of-craft-feec-4-cc-5-eb-58-1937be29bc0#c9bb9a1e-0a01-4ec3-9d30-bdd4e12c270b)
