## Highlights

> The idea is similar: A trigger is something that tells people  to perform a behavior now. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b6355b1a-9fe6-45d7-82cf-b03d6e1cf6f7)  

> With traditional media like TV or  newspapers, immediate response wasn’t usually possible. We  might encounter a trigger in a magazine ad or hear something on  the radio, but then we would have to change our context to  perform the behavior, such as driving to the store to make a  purchase. However, today we can take action immediately with  and through computers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#3db572e3-4074-476b-8924-7909ca67315c)  

> The placement of this star  is symbolic, meant to suggest that high motivation and high ability  are typically necessary for a target behavior to occur. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#712c97df-ba32-48c9-bb21-bdae1d117863)  

> The third element of simplicity is physical effort. Behaviors that  require physical effort may not be simple. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#a48cc6da-4f43-4c9b-b59e-67851b9cbb45)  

> Without an appropriate  trigger, behavior will not occur even if both motivation and ability  are high. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#7f1f2f82-19fa-4633-992a-7b09e03772ee)  

> The first core motivator in the FBM is a dimension that has two  sides: pleasure and pain. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#8d6e8529-8bbb-4e6c-8c24-1ef7d04bf13b)  

> Suppose a web site creator wants to persuade site visitors to sign  up for a newsletter by entering their email address. That behavior  – typing in an email address – is the target behavior. In the FBM  this target behavior is represented by a star. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#fcba8f96-bb6a-4c10-bf17-e96156b617a2)  

> One of my goals is to practice the ukulele each day. This little  instrument is great fun, but some days I don’t practice. Why not?  Let me explain. I like practicing the ukulele, and it’s easy to do. I  have sufficient motivation and ability. What’s missing is a welltimed trigger. I lack something that says, “Hey, right now is a  great time to play the ukulele!” Without this trigger in my life, I  don’t do this target behavior each day. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#a08b7fed-e4d2-41b2-bc28-734e43cde823)  

> this motivator is immediate,  or nearly so. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#fcc60ba8-674f-4e40-98b5-f17b6793ea93)  

> Not all triggers function in the same way. Below I describe three types of triggers: sparks, facilitators, and signals. A spark is a  trigger that motivates behavior. A facilitator makes behavior  easier. And a signal indicates or reminds. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#0586fcae-7825-4986-be2d-d7f598b3a2ba)  

> Triggers can cause us to act on impulse. For example, when Facebook sends me an email notification that someone has tagged  me in a photo, I can immediately click on a link in that email to  view the image. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#dbc6b820-0588-434d-b3d1-6ae0b8f04fe1)  

> The next factor in simplicity is what I call “brain cycles.” If  performing a target behavior causes us to think hard, that might  not be simple. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b75dc233-d010-4b19-8f97-a625f405aad4)  

> Also on Figure 1 is a factor I call “triggers.” The placement of this word is close to the target behavior star to imply that the trigger  must be present for the target behavior to occur. While the axes  are fixed, one can imagine that the star, representing the target  behavior, as well as the related trigger, could be placed anywhere  inside the plane defined by the axes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#3b7455c8-dde7-47f7-b344-211ef960a5be)  

> Pleasure and pain are powerful motivators. When designers are  seeking to boost levels of motivation, they can look at how  pleasure and pain can be embodied. This motivator type may not  be the ideal approach, especially pain, but a thorough review of  motivation means at least acknowledging these options. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#51317643-daf6-4957-a0ff-bd8da09a920a)  

> When a person lacks motivation to perform a target behavior, a trigger should be designed in tandem with a motivational element. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#a74e3be4-95f8-4e3c-bb2a-ce64b63a1390)  

> A trigger can take many forms – an alarm that sounds, a text  message, an announcement that a sale is ending, a growling  stomach, and so on. Whatever the form, successful triggers have  three characteristics: First, we notice the trigger. Second, we  associate the trigger with a target behavior. Third, the trigger  happens when we are both motivated and able to perform the  behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#7906bfe3-6d34-46c7-9ecb-7ac2d719db43)  

> Deviance [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#36439078-674c-4720-bcc8-2dfa99302d67)  

Аномалия. Не норма

> In  creating sparks for persuasive experiences, designers can review  the three core motivators I’ve explained above. Sparks can  leverage any of these motivational elements. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#0f5bc860-a189-494c-8604-2a129b841fa0)  

> In this model (FBM), behavior is a product of three  factors: motivation, ability, and triggers, each of which has  subcomponents. The FBM asserts that for a person to perform a  target behavior, he or she must (1) be sufficiently motivated, (2)  have the ability to perform the behavior, and (3) be triggered to  perform the behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b6b9d6d3-7170-4103-8b7e-9e9a1b29c06d)  

> The fifth element of simplicity is less obvious than the others. I call it “social deviance.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#52af68e5-7b84-41d8-8c7f-f6a61d6f8477)  

> To effectively encode experiences that change behaviors, we need a  rich yet practical understanding of human psychology, specifically  insights into the factors that drive human behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#5f5509e6-8a0b-4b95-8384-cd3a6b17f792)  

> The second core motivator in the FBM is a dimension that has two sides: hope and fear. This dimension is characterized by  anticipation of an outcome. Hope is the anticipation of something  good happening. Fear is the anticipation of something bad, often  the anticipation of loss. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#cc06427c-4fb9-46da-87f2-684f933cb817)  

> The purpose of the FBM is to help us, as researchers and designers, think more clearly about behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#3b5f5c38-c95f-4aad-b695-0dcf16845691)  

> For example, wearing pajamas to a city council meeting  might require the least effort, but there’s a social price I’d pay,  which creates complications for that behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#a2e6e2ab-e0a8-4e2e-baaf-53cc7d303419)  

> But hope/fear is not always more motivating than pleasure/pain. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#0fab1d0f-d6a1-4a9a-8ff0-d745c42c6523)  

> In these situations, the FBM helps people think  systematically about the elements of motivation, elements of  simplicity, and the strategies used for triggering behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#18bcf051-e646-4056-a75e-ef6979310495)  

> The second trigger type is what I call a “facilitator.” This type of  trigger is appropriate for users that have high motivation but lack  ability. The goal of a facilitator is to trigger the behavior while  also making the behavior easier to do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#727356f1-784a-4528-a51f-b1613ea96567)  

> People tend to find behaviors simple if they are routine, activities they do over and over again. When people face a  behavior that is not routine, then they may not find it simple. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#188d5489-e635-4cf9-bef8-2c1f23ef399f)  

> When the combination  of motivation and ability places a person above the behavior  activation threshold, then a trigger will cause that person to  perform the target behavior [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#5a497d68-a7f5-4848-8f83-9bf77c0ea7fb)  

> behavior activation threshold [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#61a39cff-22c5-4632-aede-0fd392f43fae)  

> The FBM implies that motivation and ability are trade-offs of a sort. People with low motivation may perform a behavior if the  behavior is simple enough (meaning, high on ability). For  example, right now I have very low motivation to buy a new car.  But if someone offered me a new car for $1, I would buy it. My  ability to pay $1 is high, so I would buy the car despite my low  level of motivation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b4d757b6-04e5-483f-af0a-398241839714)  

> Hope and fear have long been powerful motivators in persuasive  technology. For example, people are motivated by hope when then  joining a dating web site. They are motivated by fear when they  update settings in virus software. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#ce8105d6-7440-4d3b-9228-e4725f0b2f8d)  

> An effective facilitator tells users that the target behavior is easy to do, that it won’t require a resource he or she does not have at that  moment. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#3b531bd0-6b0b-439c-a2c9-6defb0ccd83c)  

> For example software updates often use facilitators to  gain compliance by implying that one click can get the job done.  Recently, many social networking sites have grown quickly by  offering users an “address book uploader,” which requires just a  few clicks to connect with many friends. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#03dddf53-c131-44eb-ab37-52ff8376b3e2)  

> Each person has a different simplicity profile. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#1e935aac-9530-4415-acc4-9f369780ab02)  

> The third core motivator in the FBM is a social dimension that has two sides: social acceptance and social rejection. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#549b223b-4d3f-4194-8ae2-05006a8c45e1)  

> The first element of simplicity is time. If a target behavior requires  time and we don’t have time available, then the behavior is not  simple. For example, if I need to fill out an online form that has  100 fields in it, that behavior is not simple for me because I  usually have other demands on my time. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b756edb2-cd46-4146-a59d-e486f4dc5008)  

> It’s clear that people are motivated to do  things that win them social acceptance. Perhaps even more  dramatically, people are motivated to avoid being socially  rejected. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#afc520ad-2577-4b5d-b50c-2eb56dca7a5b)  

> The third and final type of trigger is what I call a “signal.” This trigger type works best when people have both the ability and the  motivation to perform the target behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#2fa115a4-2ffc-4a01-9299-0e2682cd0fec)  

> Simplicity  is a function of a person’s scarcest resource. Even more accurate is  this statement: Simplicity is a function of a person’s scarcest  resource at the moment a behavior is triggered. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b9d89653-77da-441f-b68a-b9cfd76cd429)  

> If we want to perform a behavior, a well-timed trigger is welcome.  But when our motivation is low for that behavior, a trigger is  distracting. Conversely, when we want to perform the behavior  being triggered but lack ability, we feel frustrated.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#134259c9-686a-4bf1-9a9b-d8e1b33b5d98)  

> The signal doesn’t seek  to motivate people or simplify the task. It just serves as a  reminder. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#90fd365f-79c8-4323-babd-5d8287adfa8c)  

> f  motivation is high enough, people might do extraordinary things – even difficult things – to perform the behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#e63a8040-e29a-4176-9f8a-55ce673b3391)  

> In general, persuasive design focuses on increasing motivation, increasing ability (simplicity), and  triggering behavior. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#f3905d82-8b0f-41da-8fab-7aaf782add94)  

> The next element of simplicity is money. For people with limited  financial resources, a target behavior that costs money is not  simple. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#862b3ce5-09f6-4ada-9ef8-59ed8abf7bdf)  

> An ordinary example of a signal is a traffic light that turns red or green. The traffic light is not trying to motivate me.; it simply  indicates when a behavior is appropriate. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#26d55a70-f3a3-487f-bd50-a3f0372e94ac)  

> Today, with social technologies a reality, the methods for  motivating people through social acceptance or social rejection  have blossomed. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#220c3aea-9596-4fd3-9143-ee568e3d9d43)  

> In general, persuasive design  succeeds faster when we focus on making the behavior simpler  instead of trying to pile on motivation. Why? People often resist  attempts at motivation, but we humans naturally love simplicity. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#fab1a749-3c5b-41ea-9ba0-b63cceaf3c96)  

> There are no units on this axis, as the framework is conceptual, showing relationships of the  components rather than precise values for each. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#b5811931-0427-49e9-af6a-ac0e58033c2c)  

> The goal in designing for motivation is, conceptually, to move a  user to a higher position in the FBM landscape. In other words, the  users who have high ability but low motivation need to have  motivation increased so they cross the behavior activation  threshold. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-f-4295-a-86-d-6-ee-11-ee-86-ca-9-bd-050-aa-2-f-48-captology-be-18df4738691#e971607c-a2b1-4834-9f5d-15e4c675ded2)  

From growth:

Customer Desire Alignment
The best way to frame your product is to deeply understand the subtleties of the Motivation axis of your customers.
The key is to know the customers' Hopes, Pains, Barriers and context so well that you start thinking like them.
You discover that through user research, Jobs-To-Be-Done interviews and
