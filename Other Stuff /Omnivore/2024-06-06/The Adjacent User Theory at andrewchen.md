## Highlights

> Most product teams know their existing users pretty well. But your future audience is always evolving. The challenges that these potential users face in adopting the product increase over time. Without a team dedicated to understanding, advocating, and building for your next set of users, you end up never expanding your audience. This stalls growth, and the product never reaches the level you aspire it to.

> You can think about your product as a series of circles. Each of these circles is defined by the primary user states that someone could be in. For example Power, Core, Casual, Signed Up, Visitor. Each one of these circles have users that are “in orbit” around it. These users have an equal or greater chance they drift off into space rather than crossing the threshold to the next state.

> There are a few things that tend to lead teams away from focusing on the adjacent user:
> 
> * Focusing On The Power User
> * Personas Are The Wrong Tool
> * Trying To Hit A Home Run On Every Swing [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-andrewchen-com-the-adjacent-user-theory-18fec062602#015bd9a6-a7f7-4e13-9973-0e095e93feeb)  

> Product teams by nature are [power users](https://andrewchen.co/power-user-curve/) of their own product. The parts of the product that the product team uses, tend to automatically get improved as the pain is right in front of them. But this leads to building for yourself (or your friends).
