## Highlights

> * **Demand why-nows** (shifts in what people want and need). _Examples:_  
> * Changes in societal norms, preferences, or behaviors, including new uses of technology  
> * Shifts in population demographics  
> * Shifts in your customer’s industry dynamics (especially ones that reduce profitability of the status quo)  
> * Changes in your customer’s competitive landscape (including recent, widespread disappointment with competitor products)  
> * Regulatory changes that spur demand for your offering
> * **Supply why-nows** (some recent advancement that makes your solution more possible, affordable, or profitable). _Examples:_  
> * Newly available technologies or data  
> * Changes in the economics of supply, production or distribution  
> * Regulatory changes that make it possible to deliver your offering  
> * Changes in your competitive landscape [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-figma-grows-design-beyond-designers-191d4b4f6ef#6d1eb0ae-5bdc-4c3f-b746-d9741618465b)  

> Part of that criticism probably came from the fact that there was a disconnect between what the market saw as currently possible, vs what the Figma team knew was _becoming_ increasingly possible. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-figma-grows-design-beyond-designers-191d4b4f6ef#f84c61a6-da70-40c0-8839-00b6e8f22eba)  

> That definitely does not mean ignore your customers. As we’ll see, Figma values a very tight proximity to their community. But it does mean you have to sharpen your sense about what to ignore, even if it seems like existential feedback (e.g I hate your vision).

> **There will always be criticism.** And I think that the more vocal the criticism is from a group of people, perhaps there’s some correlation there with the level of success a product will have.

> One tactical thing worth noting about Figma’s culture in the early days, and to some degree, still through to today:
> 
> 1. They make sure everyone at Figma uses Figma. Dogfooding their own product is a key principle.
> 2. They had/have everyone, including devs, spend time with customer support. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-figma-grows-design-beyond-designers-191d4b4f6ef#f48a0367-8cda-49c8-aaa7-ad6aa1ad36e1)  

> You want engineers looped into customer conversations and strategic planning, because it means they have deep context to make decisions quickly while they work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-figma-grows-design-beyond-designers-191d4b4f6ef#5476bde2-5be8-4da1-871d-3b672caaec64)  

> _**What got you here won’t get you there**_. AKA, you generally can't accomplish what you want/need to in the long-term with a single _**loop.**_ 
> 
> This is because e_very single product_ has a natural lifecycle that ends with a flatter maturity line. Growth rates _always_ tapper off. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-figma-grows-design-beyond-designers-191d4b4f6ef#27159059-f7aa-4007-90eb-3916f78edebc)  

> This is where the idea of S-curves comes in. To keep growing—just like a fire needs fresh logs—a company often needs to keep finding the next loop that piggy-backs on existing strengths. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-figma-grows-design-beyond-designers-191d4b4f6ef#f97f4a95-ecaf-4118-a44d-0b14a691bc75)  

> One of the things that I've really been impressed by with Dylan, and just the Figma culture in general, is this blend of having a vision for where things should go, but also being cognizant of where people are and what they need in the moment, and then trying to balance those two desires. It’s not just about being purely visionary, but also being reactive and adaptive. You need to know what people need right now.
