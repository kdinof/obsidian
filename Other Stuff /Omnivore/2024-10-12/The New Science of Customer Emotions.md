## Highlights

> When companies connect with customers’ emotions, the payoff can be huge. Consider these examples: After a major bank introduced a credit card for Millennials that was designed to inspire emotional connection, use among the segment increased by 70% and new account growth rose by 40%. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#e4c4f9f7-5228-471b-beb4-e9770f691d41)  

> Given the enormous opportunity to create new value, companies should pursue emotional connections as a science—and a strategy. But for most, building these connections is more guesswork than science. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#bd94b35f-f918-4579-a751-d4e519b51724)  

> At the most basic level, any company can begin a structured process of learning about its customers’ emotional motivators and conducting experiments to leverage them, later scaling up from there. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#b362f243-800a-4867-b77f-f2cdef270f65)  

> The most sophisticated firms are making emotional connection part of a broad strategy that involves every function in the value chain, from product development and marketing to sales and service. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#5c626f29-486e-4e92-9bc5-60a4c7e3763e)  

Look for what is a value chain

> Our research stemmed from our frustration that companies we worked with knew customers’ emotions were important but couldn’t figure out a consistent way to define them, connect with them, and link them to results. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#59a9c677-6c73-4967-a53a-5f339d78e07a)  

Emotions → results 

> consider customers to be emotionally connected with a brand when it aligns with their motivations and helps them fulfill deep, often unconscious, desires. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#b01c5a44-e9e1-4516-a7c1-91c18a353b9e)  

> Identifying and measuring emotional motivators is complicated, because customers themselves may not even be aware of them. These sentiments are typically different from what customers _say_ are the reasons they make brand choices and from the terms they use to describe their emotional responses to particular brands. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#af583f57-cf0f-4e84-9227-61cef11e09fc)  

> The process, in brief, looks like this: Applying big data analytics to detailed customer-data sets, we first identify the emotional motivators for a category’s most valuable customers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#18d8815a-f306-46cd-9220-01272404d55d)  

> Next we use statistical modeling to look at a large number of customers and brands, comparing survey results about people’s emotional motivators with their purchase behavior and identifying spikes in buying that are associated with specific motivators. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#812a5085-1f6b-488d-a0c5-33bf13fb8781)  

> which motivators generate the most-profitable customer behaviors in the category. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#57af8ae5-2530-4dff-b438-1cbc7e234c7f)  

Interesting thought 

> Although customers exhibit increasing connection at each step, their value increases dramatically when they reach the fourth step: Fully connected customers are 52% more valuable, on average, than those who are just highly satisfied. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#bd201521-ab2d-4200-af2a-6f4f7bfeae73)  

> The pathway is an important guide to where companies should invest—and it reveals that they often invest in the wrong places. To increase revenue and market share, many companies focus on turning dissatisfied customers into satisfied ones. However, our analysis shows that moving customers from highly satisfied to fully connected can have three times the return of moving them from unconnected to highly satisfied. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#4faf0bfb-6973-4306-91ed-58c79befc47c)  

> To increase revenue and market share, many companies focus on turning dissatisfied customers into satisfied ones. However, our analysis shows that moving customers from highly satisfied to fully connected can have three times the return of moving them from unconnected to highly satisfied. And the highest returns we’ve seen have come from focusing on customers who are already fully connected to the category—from maximizing their value and attracting more of them to your brand. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#34b9fbe6-d42c-4c13-a4da-12f6cf656bb8)  

> Emotional motivators also vary within categories, depending on the desires of brands’ most valuable customers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#fb74bcdf-a04b-47ab-8314-91bbebbb54ef)  

> Because brands differ in how well they align with their customers’ motivators, each may have a different starting point in any effort to strengthen emotional connections—and that point won’t necessarily relate to conventional measures of brand perception. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-new-science-of-customer-emotions-1927e870018#1820b987-d1d9-4791-a646-f6efaa7171fa)  

> In banking, the desire to “feel secure” is a critical motivator when attracting and retaining customers early on. When cross-selling products later, the wish to “succeed in life” becomes more important.
