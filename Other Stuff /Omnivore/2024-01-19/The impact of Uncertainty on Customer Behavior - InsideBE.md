## Highlights

> But uncertainty can act as a major show-stopper **in any sales funnel**. That’s why the most successful companies like Netflix, Paypal, or [Zara](https://insidebe.com/articles/how-zara-uses-social-proof/) adjust their sign-up process & checkout funnels to eliminate uncertainties at each step of the way. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-impact-of-uncertainty-on-customer-behavior-inside-be-18d118e1589#2b146a20-c945-4782-8fc4-52c5fa525088)  

> As you can see below they don’t solely focus on the benefits (ad-free, multiple screens, option to download) but alleviate potential concerns, such as whether a user can cancel at any time and won’t be charged without being notified first, by putting them front and center in their registration funnel. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-impact-of-uncertainty-on-customer-behavior-inside-be-18d118e1589#cc6d8d5e-9584-4288-8aff-24e1be461cf4)  

Фокусироваться не на фичах, а на решение проблем и вопросов, которые есть у пользователя 

> Since uncertainty is widespread, it means that before you start thinking of ways to motivate customers to engage with you or to buy from you, you have to [begin by understanding their main uncertainties and dealing with them.](https://insidebe.com/articles/understand-your-customers-barriers/) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-impact-of-uncertainty-on-customer-behavior-inside-be-18d118e1589#686f873f-6867-4198-8b53-d671a8868583)  

Какие способы могут быть, чтобы понять вопросы и неопределенности клиента магазина  

> If your deal is (objectively) great, but your customers are still not flocking towards it, rather than pushing even harder on the gas pedal – which could look like repeating the key benefits in your email and reminder email and the last call email – consider what is the handbrake (uncertainty) that you first need to remove. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-impact-of-uncertainty-on-customer-behavior-inside-be-18d118e1589#5dbd0de4-1f27-4d95-a613-1da15894ed32)  

> * **Don’t just broadcast benefits, understand reservations.** In the case of the bank, the uncertainty was not knowing how to take advantage of the different features of the apps (and what it meant). The company could push these benefits for years to no avail; it took understanding what the problem was to fix it.
> * **Check your message for clarity.** Friends, family members, first dates, anyone can be your guinea pig. See how they interact with your landing page, job posting, or checkout page. Do they understand what you want them to do and how? Is your message correctly understood? Does it speak to not just the value but also possible concerns and reservations? Mark down the additional questions they have – those are the ones you need to answer.
> * **Address your customers’ uncertainties at the right time.** Think about where in their decision-making process a customer would benefit from seeing the choices other people made. Is it before they even choose a product, or later in the sales funnel (as in the case of ZARA)?
> * **Be transparent about trepidation.** If there’s an elephant in the room, omitting it from your communication won’t make it go away. It will make people pause in their tracks. Commitment concerns are a major deal breaker so make sure you always answer the question: how can I step away from it if I don’t like it?
