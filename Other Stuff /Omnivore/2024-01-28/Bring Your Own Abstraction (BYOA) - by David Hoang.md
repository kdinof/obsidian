## Highlights

> An abstraction in computer software is a way of simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential features and ignoring unnecessary details. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/bring-your-own-abstraction-byoa-by-david-hoang-18d4fafa89d#0d0cf378-5f1a-4a7c-a03f-caf170356ca7)  

> Comprehension is dynamic and changes over time. Rigid interfaces don’t accommodate for this and as a result, comprehension is often neglected. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/bring-your-own-abstraction-byoa-by-david-hoang-18d4fafa89d#eae09ef9-7a4b-49ce-ad4d-ef7091bd1bd2)  

> We should strive for an elegant experience to make end users as successful as possible, but you can’t expect all animals in a zoo to shit in a cat's litter box. Various roles and behaviors have different expectations. Being too abstracted might create more work for people who need to achieve complex tasks while being too complex might create a barrier too great for people to adopt it.

> In a world where LLMs can retrieve data and abstractions can be tailored to an individual, we could see a world where the authoring space is completely personalized in real-time.

> In [Issue 129](https://www.proofofconcept.pub/p/pondering-the-future-of-interaction), I agreed with many that the desktop metaphor needs to be retired. My proposal is instead of Personal Computers with time-shared commuting, the new metaphor is a shared communal space.
