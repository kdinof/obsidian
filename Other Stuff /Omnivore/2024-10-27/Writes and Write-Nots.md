## Highlights

> in a couple decades there won't be many people who can write. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#f5188eaa-6867-499e-9b11-289cd89eaa68)  

> The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly, and thinking clearly is hard. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#bcf9b8a7-3951-4400-ad5f-359c5c5c5b68)  

> The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#b24c27e1-28d0-4417-a4e3-9c656e964707)  

> But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and those who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good writers and people who can't write. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#f9ff0108-a893-4418-8ee6-79cfcc7b6576)  

> Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport did:

> > If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#676dcc45-1a38-4ccd-8adb-1288497f1639)  

> In preindustrial times most people's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who choose to be. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#dd51d4e7-fd62-40a8-8c21-a94f40778faa)  

> It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people, but only those who choose to be. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/writes-and-write-nots-192cd83dc19#57049e5e-6180-4682-a913-f85fc9db0bbe)
