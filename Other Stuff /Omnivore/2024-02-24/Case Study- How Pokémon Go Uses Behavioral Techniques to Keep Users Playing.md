## Highlights

> Instead of people wandering around the venue to experience a differently themed area of the event, 5 themes rotate all throughout the day worldwide.
> 
> That is, every hour, the theme of the event changes, giving you new activities to do and Pokémon to catch. Combine that with an array of special bonuses and the expectation of unique combinations (a new theme + a new bonus), and you’ll keep coming back for more just to make sure you’re not missing out on something great.

> In a [case study from 2018](https://www.salecycle.com/blog/strategies/case-study-using-countdown-timers-during-black-friday-sales/), the company SalesCycle measured the effectiveness of countdowns used in various locations on their clients’ websites during Black Friday and found that added time pressure can increase **conversions by as much as 220%!** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-pokemon-go-uses-behavioral-techniques-to-keep-use-18dd955e921#72795976-d70b-4b91-8162-9d8975d24007)  

> Watching the progress bar crawl under a combined effort of millions of players worldwide, you being one of them, is something that just pushes you to do your part. And once more, the race against the clock is used to make the struggle real for everyone involved.

> **A similar principle is used by many crowdfunding sites** on the internet with [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) being one of the most famous. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-pokemon-go-uses-behavioral-techniques-to-keep-use-18dd955e921#3dccac33-7165-4fdf-a90d-c6c82b163dcc)  

> Completing community challenges rewards you with special boosts to your character, but these boosts only last for an hour after completing the challenge.
> 
> **You, your buddies, and people all around the world have worked so hard** to conquer the challenge. **What makes you think you’ll want to miss even a second of that sweet, sweet reward boost?** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-pokemon-go-uses-behavioral-techniques-to-keep-use-18dd955e921#867e8c21-fdd2-4ce0-8e78-99a928201b16)  

> When it comes to loss aversion, you’ve definitely been a target of this approach more than once, that’s for sure. **Remember that time you wanted to book four nights at a hotel in Amsterdam on** [**booking.com**](https://www.booking.com/)**?**
> 
> After finding your ideal hotel room, you noticed that there were only 2 of them left and they were booking fast. In situations like this, **your brain switches to “scarcity” mode and leads you down the path of loss aversion**. You don’t want to miss the chance to snag a bargain room, so you rush to speed up your decision and click “book now.”
> 
> All so you can breathe a sigh of relief knowing the pressures of FOMO are behind you now that you’ve locked in your decision. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-pokemon-go-uses-behavioral-techniques-to-keep-use-18dd955e921#f1fd0e80-9658-4f81-b366-9313c275d671)  

> A [2019 study from UPS ](https://www.ups.com/media/en/2014-UPS-Pulse-of-the-Online-Shopper.pdf)found that about **23% of customers abandon their shopping carts when the checkout process seems too long**. The progress bar, which breaks the check-out process up into smaller “digestible” chunks can help those shoppers retain their grip and follow through with the process. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-pokemon-go-uses-behavioral-techniques-to-keep-use-18dd955e921#c8c0bfd8-0851-432c-8a6b-caa60ea76746)  

> If you’re aware that your friends can monitor your progress as easily as you can monitor theirs, then you’re less likely to be the slacker at the bottom of the leaderboard. Maybe it’s because you want to be a valued member of your clan, or maybe you just love seeing yourself at the top of the leaderboard… The reasons may vary, but one thing remains certain: it will make you want to play for just a little while longer just so you can see yourself climb to the top.

> #### Key Takeaways:
> 
> * **Make it easy**. Think about what might be preventing your customers from reaching out to you and making a purchase. In the case of Pokémon GO Fest, the main showstopper has been the need to go to a predetermined location. What points in the purchase process make your customers leave the most? Is there any way to simplify those steps or remove them altogether?
> * **Apply scarcity** **and time pressure** by adding information about the number of products in stock or the time customers have left to act.
> * **Use salient feedback and a sense of progress** to motivate customers to finish your registration process or advance through a purchase funnel. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-pokemon-go-uses-behavioral-techniques-to-keep-use-18dd955e921#b0eb487b-c4ba-4cad-9fd4-fc0e3525cfbd)
