## Highlights

> To find what was going wrong, Kornel and his team had to start as early as possible in the customer journey. First, they looked at **how prospective customers could find the information they needed** regarding the available offers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-one-bank-increased-sales-of-current-accounts-by-3-18dd95a5274#95452b5f-116a-45a0-9538-a3a4cd5a861d)  

> Although the information was all there on the website, and in the form of leaflets and brochures in branches, this information was not in one place. In the branches it was in **separate standalone documents** for each package, and on the website, it was **spread across three different pages**, requiring customers to click on three separate links to find and read it. 
> 
> This created **immediate friction for the customer** in making any comparison or decision. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-one-bank-increased-sales-of-current-accounts-by-3-18dd95a5274#4eebc244-9f16-4220-90f5-aa180347d804)  

> Customers who are faced with uncertain situations or who fear making a wrong decision, tend to **fall back on the simplest option as a safe harbor from potential mistakes or the unknown**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-one-bank-increased-sales-of-current-accounts-by-3-18dd95a5274#a496b8aa-e6d8-419e-b2e6-943628819e34)  

> Firstly, immediately upon entering the bank, customers were greeted with these choices when taking a ticket to see an advisor:
> 
> * Current account opening
> * Credit application
> * Transaction
> * Cash payments
> * Premium Services
> 
> Yes, that’s right. The very first thing they saw was exactly what they already wanted and **what the bank hoped to steer them away from** – a current account. Before they had spoken to anyone or seen any other offers, their first action confirmed this as the **default option**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-one-bank-increased-sales-of-current-accounts-by-3-18dd95a5274#2fa4e32a-c1a3-4ae9-8a3f-3308ea3052b7)  

> In both cases the intervention was quite straightforward. Simply **renaming the option to Transactional Banking Packages immediately forced people to explore alternatives**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/case-study-how-one-bank-increased-sales-of-current-accounts-by-3-18dd95a5274#e3a03400-1477-4833-84f3-884e9808bf85)  

> * **Start by understanding the customer journey.** Follow the entire path that the customers have to go through. Any stage of the sales funnel – awareness, interest, decision, action – can have friction which may make your customer switch to another track.
> * **Be careful what defaults you unintentionally create.** If the design of the customer journey or the buying process defaults your customers to the wrong options, it will be difficult to change their choices.
> * **Help customers choose by asking them the right questions** instead of showing them a confusing list of features. When customers see information that they can recognize as similar to their own behavior or pattern, they find it easier to connect to a given choice.
> * **Never compromise on testing**. Sometimes improvement is immediately visible in the design phase of a new approach. But even if the solution appears straightforward, insist on testing. Measurement is essential to boost confidence in the final roll-out.
