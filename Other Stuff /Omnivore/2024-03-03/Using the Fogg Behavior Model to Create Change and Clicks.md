## Highlights

> Because behavior is everything. Every action you take. Every action you want others to take: employees, customers, your family. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#122dff3e-9f00-4bd4-87b1-be89a213f7d1)  

> BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model is a way to better understand behavior—or lack of it—so you can change or encourage it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#b1bff656-adda-45b7-ac3a-190810390ed7)  

> Whether you want your customers to take action.  
> Whether you want to overcome your habits to build new ones.  
> Whether you want your employees to perform or take change well. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#9c315f98-1218-4aa9-bc87-4d4b53fef17b)  

> The Fogg Behavior Model is based on the fundamental idea that behavior (B) occurs when three things align: motivation (M), ability (A), and prompt (P). If one of these is missing, then the behavior you want won’t occur. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#f037de39-5ee2-44a4-ac4b-5c63e1547763)  

> The **Action Line** shows where action takes place. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#d438d89c-fa3b-41c8-b4d7-8f24326c32a7)  

> **1\. Sensation (Physical Motivation)**  
> _Pleasure/Pain_  
> People naturally try to avoid pain and gain pleasure. It’s really that simple.
> 
> **2.** **Anticipation (Emotional Motivation)**  
> _Hope/Fear_  
> We prefer hope, but fear of the worst can be equally powerful (it’s why people buy insurance). Just keep in mind ethics when dealing with fear.
> 
> This future-focused core motivator is also associated with purpose in an existential sense.
> 
> **3\. Belonging (Social Motivation)**  
> _Acceptance/Rejection_  
> This is where community comes in. We’re social creatures, after all. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#7b33115f-f22b-420d-b778-fee3ad020628)  

> 1\. **Training**: This is the hardest method and only recommended if required, especially in the case of customer behavior. Most people don’t want training; they want things to be intuitive.  
> 2\. **Tools**: [Tools](https://boldist.co/technology/best-ecommerce-integrations/) exist solely to make tasks easier.  
> 3\. **Simplicity**: Simplify the steps to the behavior you want. Make practice sessions shorter; reduce the number of questions in your survey; require fewer clicks to finalize a purchase. In our field, this is all about removing friction. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#7961debd-6102-41ed-a31b-5e653df7a134)  

> **There are 5 potentially scarce resources to be aware of when creating ability:**
> 
> 1. Time
> 2. Money
> 3. Physical Effort
> 4. Mental Effort
> 5. Routine [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#b2eab3d9-b920-4781-b71b-d17c9cfb60ee)  

> If you’re unsure how to simplify a desired behavior, look at **which factor is scarcest at the time of your prompt**. How can you reduce it or address it at that moment? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#d750b663-11c5-469e-8531-ccbcd34297eb)  

> If a task doesn’t fit into one’s routine, it becomes challenging and uncomfortable. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#83c91c67-50de-4c4e-9329-abb0e97589ff)  

> **Facilitator**: For motivated individuals, facilitators prompt the behavior and contribute to ability—say, by walking the individual through the steps.  
> 2. **Spark**: For those with ability, sparks prompt the behavior while “sparking” motivation. You want to be careful with sparks; if they fail, you may annoy people lacking the intent you need.  
> 3. **Signal**: Signals are a sign or reminder for those who already have ability and motivation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#e8156b45-1e5f-41cf-bc38-9bdf02589383)  

> For behavior change to succeed, you need motivation, ability, and prompt **simultaneously**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#6b898cfc-663e-49a9-94a4-6d3ae99426c0)  

> A great example of the importance of “the right prompt at the right time” is [the $300-million-dollar button](https://articles.centercentre.com/three%5Fhund%5Fmillion%5Fbutton/): a case study where changing one button (and yes, a button is a prompt) made a company $300,000,000.
> 
> The company required users to fill out a form before checking out.
> 
> It was a simple username and password form. It had the buttons “login” and “register.”
> 
> The problem?
> 
> Many potential customers bounced because they couldn’t remember their login or if they already had an account (ability). Others left because they didn’t want to create an account (motivation).
> 
> In the end, replacing the “Register” button with the option to simply “Continue” was all it took to, well, get buyers to continue.
> 
> (If you’re wondering, they gave the option to create an account later during checkout.) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#0f29bc94-f853-4b7f-a58f-da959f231458)  

> Here’s a list of example tactics that target the core motivators of sensation, anticipation, and belonging.
> 
> * Gamify tasks
> * Use levels to track progress
> * Celebrate achievements
> * Use limited offers to create scarcity

> * Create curiosity
> * Put a date on results to bring the future into sight
> * Provide social proof
> * Appeal to status and reputation
> * Give freely to encourage reciprocation (When someone gives you a gift on your birthday, you feel obligated to do the same on theirs.) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#e3d7d5ae-8050-44ad-b45c-24bf7c75d5cc)  

> ### Tactics for Increasing Ability
> 
> Here’s a list of example tactics for simplifying tasks and easing ability.
> 
> * Break tasks into more manageable parts
> * Remove distractions to encourage tunneling
> * List steps to encourage tunneling
> * Prioritize, segment, and [personalize](https://boldist.co/marketing-strategy/ecommerce-personalization-tactics-that-scale/) to reduce the amount of information to sift through

> * Use or provide automation tools
> * Identify all physical steps you can remove or simplify
> * Follow [accessibility guidelines](https://boldist.co/usability/accessible-design-for-users-with-disabilities/) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#61546c84-6c62-4bdd-a5ff-534f39c12274)  

> ### Tactics for Improving Prompts
> 
> Here are some tips to use when creating prompts.
> 
> * Never rely on recall
> * Uncover the optimal time for the prompt to trigger
> * Ensure the prompt is noticeable
> * Use recurring prompts to build routine
> * Engage with the fresh start effect (e.g., New Year’s Eve resolutions)
> * Avoid requiring resources that might not be readily available
> * Keep prompts simple
> * Opt for one small prompt at a time over multiple asks all at once
> * Prompts on cell phones are hard to miss
> * Emails and SMS are great prompting tools for ecommerce [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#e49bdcba-1d3f-416b-99fe-4c1874f85874)  

> Listing the other motivations that can and will compete with your desired behavior is the first step to preventing them from getting in your way. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#1d592bb9-b71e-4b89-84f0-03ccf64a3faa)  

> You can tap into the motivations people already have, but you can also **tap into those with the motivation and ability to meet your desired behavior**:
> 
> * The segment that has a genuine desire for your product
> * The employee with motivations that set them up to thrive in your office culture
> * The partner with the same motivations in a relationship
> * And so on [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/using-the-fogg-behavior-model-to-create-change-and-clicks-18e045be809#8eac27dd-baa6-4fdf-80ea-c455b04633e8)
