# Style Cloning Implementation Environment

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Libraries and Tools
- **Python 3.9+**: Base programming language
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for accessing and using LLMs
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **NLTK/spaCy**: For linguistic analysis and text processing
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: For model fine-tuning (if needed later)
- **YouTube Transcript API**: For extracting content from YouTube videos
- **PyPDF2/PDFMiner**: For processing PDF documents
- **BeautifulSoup4**: For web scraping and article extraction

### Environment Configuration
```python
# Requirements.txt
transformers>=4.30.0
langchain>=0.0.267
nltk>=3.8.1
spacy>=3.6.0
torch>=2.0.1
youtube-transcript-api>=0.6.1

```

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Content Extraction Module
- **YouTube Processor**: Extract and clean transcripts
- **PDF Processor**: Extract text, handle academic formatting
- **Web Article Processor**: Clean HTML, extract main content

### 2. Content Analysis Module
- **Key Point Extractor**: Identify main ideas and supporting details
- **Structure Analyzer**: Determine logical organization of content
- **Entity Recognition**: Identify people, organizations, concepts

### 3. Style Transfer Module
- **Prompt Template Manager**: Store and retrieve appropriate prompts
- **Style Guide Encoder**: Convert style analysis into prompt components
- **Example Generator**: Create few-shot examples for the model

### 4. Output Generation Module
- **Content Formatter**: Structure output according to user's patterns
- **Multilingual Handler**: Manage language switching and consistency
- **Quality Checker**: Verify style adherence and content accuracy

## Prompt Engineering Framework

### Base Prompt Template
```
You are an AI writing assistant that has been trained to write in the exact style and tone of [USER]. 
Your task is to transform the following raw information into a cohesive piece written precisely in [USER]'s style.

STYLE GUIDE:
[Insert key points from style_analysis.md]

EXAMPLES OF USER'S WRITING:
[Insert 2-3 short excerpts from user's samples]

RAW INFORMATION TO TRANSFORM:
[Insert extracted content from source]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Maintain the conversational and approachable tone characteristic of [USER]'s writing
2. Use a mix of short, direct sentences and longer, more complex ones
3. Incorporate rhetorical questions to engage readers
4. Include concrete examples and analogies to illustrate points
5. Structure content with clear sections and smooth transitions
6. Use first-person perspective where appropriate
7. Balance professional expertise with casual accessibility
8. If appropriate for the topic, include both Russian and English elements as [USER] would

Write a complete piece in [USER]'s authentic style based on the raw information provided:
```

## Testing and Validation Framework

### Style Consistency Tests
- **Sentence Structure Analysis**: Compare patterns with original samples
- **Vocabulary Distribution**: Check for similar word choice patterns
- **Tone Consistency**: Verify emotional tone matches user's style

### Content Accuracy Tests
- **Information Preservation**: Ensure key points from source are maintained
- **Factual Accuracy**: Verify no distortion of original information

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Set up Python environment with required dependencies
2. Implement content extraction modules for different source types
3. Develop the prompt template with style guide integration
4. Create initial test cases with simple content transformation tasks
