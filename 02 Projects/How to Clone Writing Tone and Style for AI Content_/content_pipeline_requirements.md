# Content Creation Pipeline Requirements Analysis

## Overview
The user wants to create a simplified, code-based content creation pipeline that runs locally on their machine. This pipeline will transform raw data into polished content that matches their unique tone and style.

## Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Raw Data Input
- User will provide raw data in markdown format
- User will handle transcription and initial data preparation
- System needs to process this markdown input

### Step 2: Article Idea Generation
- Generate content ideas based on:
  - User's blog thematic
  - Target audience characteristics
  - Current trends
- Ideas should be relevant and engaging

### Step 3: Draft Creation
- Create initial draft in a neutral, natural tone
- Draft should be well-structured and comprehensive
- User will review and approve before proceeding

### Step 4: Style Transformation
- Transform approved draft to match user's unique tone and style
- Maintain content accuracy while applying stylistic elements
- Final output should read as if written by the user

## Key Requirements

1. **Local Execution**: All processing should happen on the user's local machine
2. **Code-Based**: Implementation should use programming rather than no-code tools
3. **Quality Evaluation**: Need methods to assess output quality
4. **Improvement Strategies**: Need approaches to enhance output quality
5. **Clear Documentation**: Detailed instructions for implementation
6. **Effective Prompts**: Well-crafted prompts for each pipeline stage

## Technical Considerations

- Will likely use Python as the primary language
- Will need to integrate with OpenAI or similar LLM APIs
- Should handle markdown processing efficiently
- Should include error handling and quality checks
- Should be modular for easy maintenance and updates
