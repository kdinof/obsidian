## Stage 1: Introduction and Warm-Up

**Kirill (ideal candidate):**  
"Hi, [HM Name]! Thank you for having me. **My design journey spans more than 10 years, from hands-on work to leadership roles in product design and UX.** In recent years, I’ve focused on building and scaling digital products, leading design teams, and implementing scalable design systems. A particularly meaningful chapter was at **Skyeng**, where I immersed myself in EdTech and rose to lead the UX department.

As for UULA, I’m drawn to **your mission—“helping people succeed,”** especially within educational technology. The **MENA market**, where you’re actively operating, looks both promising and fascinating due to its unique challenges and opportunities. Seeing your achievements, including the Red Dot award for the ‘UULA – علا’ app, convinced me that UULA takes design and innovation seriously—aligning perfectly with my professional values and aspirations."

## Stage 2: Deep Dive into Experience and Leadership Skills

**HM:** Thank you, Kirill. That sounds impressive. Let’s discuss your leadership experience in more detail.  
"Given your background—leading a large team at Skyeng and driving product growth for a multimillion-user audience at Yandex—how do you build and lead high-performing design teams? What are your key principles for mentoring and talent development?"

**Kirill:**  
"At Skyeng, where I managed a team of 25 UX specialists, and at Yandex, leading the Acquisition & Growth team for Kinopoisk, I followed several core principles.  
First, **create a clear vision and shared goals.** The team must understand where we’re headed and why their work matters—this aligns efforts and motivates everyone.  
Second, **trust and autonomy.** I give designers the space to make decisions and own their areas, while my role is to supply resources and remove roadblocks. For example, at Skyeng we successfully relaunched the design system, which required tight collaboration and trust in each team member’s expertise, cutting non-standard components by 25%.  
Third, **talent development.** I believe in continuous learning and growth—regular 1-on-1s, constructive feedback, and personalized development plans. At Skyeng, 75% of my team moved into higher-level roles within a year, something I’m very proud of. We also raised the team’s eNPS by 10%, reflecting a healthy environment.  
Finally, **a culture of collaboration and openness.** Design is a team sport. I encourage knowledge-sharing, joint brainstorming sessions (like using BJ Fogg’s framework at Yandex), and open design reviews. Given UULA’s Red Dot-winning team, my approach would be to build on their strengths, inspire new achievements, and create conditions for further growth."

**HM:** Excellent. "Please provide an example of a project where you implemented a user-centered design process that delivered significant results. How did you link it to the company’s strategic goals?"

**Kirill:**  
"A standout example is the launch of **Skysmart Solver** at Skyeng—a lead-gen product targeting school students.  
**Situation:** We needed to build a product in three months that would attract a sizable audience and generate leads for core courses.  
**Task:** Develop the product from scratch, ensuring it appealed to the target audience and met business goals.  
**Actions (UCD process):**

1. **Research:** We conducted deep interviews with students and parents and analyzed competitors.
    
2. **Ideation & Prototyping:** We created several concepts, rapidly prototyped, and user-tested them, landing on an interactive “problem solver.”
    
3. **Design & MVP Development:** We focused on key functionality with a simple, engaging interface.
    
4. **Testing & Iteration:** We continuously gathered feedback and iterated.  
    **Results:** We reached **1 million MAU within three months** of launch. The product became a major lead-gen channel, directly supporting the company’s strategic goal of attracting new students. This shows how a UCD approach, solving real user problems, drives measurable business outcomes. Given UULA’s user-centric redesign efforts, my experience is highly relevant."
    

**Second example — Click B2B**

- **Situation:** Historically, Click lacked research both as a team and as a process. About 3–4 months ago a research team formed, and we needed to integrate it.
    
- **Task:** Embed research into the process and demonstrate its value.
    
- **Actions:**
    
    - Started with project planning—created a Gantt chart and assigned responsibilities.
        
    - Ensured research ran in parallel so it wouldn’t slow delivery.
        
    - Made research presentations vivid and data-rich so stakeholders could see the value.
        
- **Results:**
    
    - We’ve already completed two UX-testing rounds covering four scenarios and dozens of hypotheses. Some were validated and moved into refinement.
        

**HM:** Impressive numbers. "UULA Technologies says its work ‘requires constant innovation, the courage to fail, and determination.’ Tell us about a time you faced a major challenge—or even failure—on a project. How did you and your team overcome it, and what lessons did you learn?"

**Kirill:**  
"At Kinopoisk we were working to increase average order value and ran numerous A/B tests that produced no results. As Head of UX, I realized the root problem was deeper in user behavior and decided to dig into behavioral psychology.  
**Challenge:** We needed to rally everyone’s expertise to launch another experiment that would better motivate users—and do it fast, as timelines and financial metrics were tight.  
**What we did:** I gathered the team for a BJ Fogg Behavior Map brainstorm, bringing researchers in for deeper user context and idea generation.  
**Outcome:** We discovered a new, unexpected solution that delivered an incremental lift of +N% in average order value."

## Stage 3: EdTech, Strategy, and UULA Fit

**HM:** Thank you for your candor—valuable experience indeed. "What excites you about EdTech, and why UULA within the MENA market? What are your first impressions of the ‘UULA – علا’ app and its future potential?"

**Kirill:**  
"My passion for EdTech started at Skyeng. I saw how technology and design can radically transform education, making it more accessible and effective. It’s a truly inspiring field with real social impact.  
**UULA** excites me for several reasons:

1. **Mission:** ‘Helping people succeed’ is something I genuinely believe in.
    
2. **MENA Market:** A dynamic, unique region with vast potential for digital education. I’m motivated by tailoring products to cultural and linguistic specifics (e.g., RTL interfaces, local content) for maximum relevance.
    
3. **Quality Recognition:** The Red Dot award for **‘UULA – علا’** signals high design standards and company ambition.
    
    Regarding the app itself, my first impressions are very positive—significant UX and UI effort is evident. I see development potential in:
    

- **Further personalization:** Leveraging AI to create adaptive learning paths.
    
- **Deeper gamification:** To boost engagement and long-term motivation.
    
- **Expanding interactive formats:** Possibly using XR elements for a more immersive experience.
    
    I’m confident my experience launching and scaling EdTech products like Skysmart Solver will be valuable for evolving ‘UULA – علا’ and other company products."
    

**HM:** "How do you see the role of data (analytics, A/B tests) combined with qualitative research in developing UULA’s EdTech products? And how would you measure the ROI of design initiatives here?"

**Kirill:**  
"I’m a firm believer in a data-informed approach, where quantitative data and qualitative insights complement each other.  
**Role of data:**

- **Analytics (what is happening):** Identifies behavior patterns, funnel bottlenecks, popular and underused features—for instance, constant metric monitoring at Yandex pinpointed churn points.
    
- **Qualitative research (why it’s happening):** Usability tests, interviews, and surveys reveal user motivations and pain points.
    
- **A/B testing (how to improve):** Validates hypotheses rooted in data and insights, selecting the most effective solutions. Our 40% churn reduction at Yandex came from this cycle.
    
    For UULA, that means a continuous loop: analyze ‘UULA – علا’ data → spot issues/opportunities → run qualitative research → generate design hypotheses → A/B test → deploy the best solutions.  
    **Measuring design ROI:**
    

1. **Tie to business goals:** Every design initiative should target specific business KPIs (e.g., retention uplift, conversion to paid users, higher CSAT).
    
2. **Define metrics:** For each initiative, set key metrics (e.g., onboarding completion rate for a redesign, adoption rate for a new feature).
    
3. **Calculate impact:**
    
    - **Direct impact:** If a payment flow redesign boosts purchase conversion by X%, that translates directly into revenue.
        
    - **Indirect impact:** Raising CSAT (as we did at Skyeng—from 4.4 to 4.8) reduces churn and increases LTV. Optimizing via the design system (reducing non-standard components by 25% at Skyeng) saves dev time—another ROI driver.
        
    
    I’d build a transparent system where design’s contribution to UULA’s business goals is clear and measurable."
    

**HM:** "Given UULA’s global team across 20+ countries and your mission to ‘help people succeed,’ how would you ensure the design strategy advances this mission and is effectively executed by a distributed team?"

**Kirill:**  
"An excellent question—distributed collaboration is critical for UULA’s success.  
**Design strategy & mission alignment:**

- First, the design strategy must be anchored in the mission. Every decision should answer, ‘How does this help our users succeed?’ That means intuitive, motivating, pedagogically sound products.
    
- Design principles should mirror the mission—e.g., ‘Maximum clarity,’ ‘Support at every step,’ ‘Inclusivity.’
    
    **Execution by a distributed team:**
    

1. **Clear processes & communication:** Unified tools (Figma, Slack, Jira), thorough documentation, regular syncs across time zones, and an emphasis on async communication.
    
2. **Robust design system:** The foundation for consistency and efficiency. My Skyeng design-system relaunch experience will help.
    
3. **Culture of trust & accountability:** Each team member must feel ownership and autonomy within their scope.
    
4. **Inclusivity & respect for diversity:** A global team brings varied perspectives—creating an environment where every voice is heard enriches design solutions.
    
5. **Shared goals & rituals:** Regular all-hands, demos, and joint workshops (online works too) to maintain team spirit and alignment.
    
    My experience in international companies and remote team leadership (e.g., at Click, working from Jakarta) taught me how vital these aspects are."
