# A company and team with a strong product culture focused on metrics and business growth
- It’s important to me that the company has a mission, strategy, and tools that help teams understand how their work contributes to the overall mission.
- The mission and strategy should provide a clear direction for the company’s development, so I can prepare the product and team on my end to achieve our goals.
- It’s crucial that the decisions made by the team are based on data or user insights, rather than being dictated by a single person from the top.

# A company focused on innovation
AI is no longer just a buzzword (Duolingo) —it’s a set of tools that teams need to consider and implement. I’m looking for a company that understands this and is ready to, or already does, allocate resources to developing AI in its products and processes.
For example, in design, this means rapid prototyping and research, as well as content and image generation.
