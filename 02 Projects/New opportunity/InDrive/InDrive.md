## Business model
Here is a summary of InDriver's business model based on the video's caption:

- **Negotiated Pricing:** InDriver's core offering is a ride-hailing service where passengers and drivers negotiate the price of the ride directly. This contrasts with traditional ride-hailing apps that use surge pricing or pre-set rates.
- **Community Focus:** The platform fosters a sense of community by allowing users to connect and interact directly. This includes features like social media groups where riders can find drivers and vice versa.
- **Focus on Emerging Markets:** InDriver targets underserved markets and developing countries where traditional ride-hailing services may not be as prevalent or affordable.
- **Non-Profit Initiatives:** The company is involved in various social impact initiatives, such as educational programs for underprivileged youth and supporting local communities.

Essentially, InDriver aims to create a more equitable and accessible ride-hailing experience by empowering both passengers and drivers with greater control and flexibility.
