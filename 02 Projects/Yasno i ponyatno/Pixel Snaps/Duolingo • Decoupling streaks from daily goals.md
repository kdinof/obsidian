## Context
Duolingo redesigned its streak feature to better support user engagement and retention. Previously, users needed to complete their daily learning goals to maintain a streak, something that can be very high for users with higher goals. The redesign decoupled streaks from daily goals, allowing users to preserve their streaks by completing just one lesson per day, regardless of their set goal. 


Behavior tips
The core idea behind decoupling streaks from daily goals is to separate the mechanism of maintaining a streak (consecutive days of activity) from the achievement of a specific daily goal. This allows users to preserve their streak by completing a minimal amount of activity, even if they don't meet their full daily goal
- #cognitive-load previously high-pressure environment created **cognitive load** and stress, especially for users with ambitious goals, which would cause burnout. The redesign helps to reduce pressure on the user. Now users have to complete only one lesson to maintain daily streak.
- #habit-formation Because of simplicity and reducing cognitive load, it became easier to form habit. Now the habit loop (cue, routine, reward) is faster and takes less cognitive load. It also increased satisfaction of the learning process and likelihood of daily usage.
- #one-page-one-action is my motto. A lot of information and gamification mechanics on one page are always increasing cognitive load and decreasing satisfaction. Therefore, try to reduce information on the page and try to make one page — one action.

Behavior insights  
— Loss aversion: Users fear losing progress (streaks), so simplifying streak maintenance reduces the psychological burden of potential loss.
— Goal flexibility: High goals can feel overwhelming, leading to user burnout; decoupling streaks allows users to maintain a sense of achievement without the pressure of overcommitment.
— Micro-commitments: Small, achievable daily actions (one lesson) encourage consistency and form habits without users feeling overloaded.

Actions
— Simplify user goals: Design systems that allow users to feel a sense of progress without overwhelming them.
— Reduce negative consequences: Minimize user punishment (e.g., streak loss) to maintain motivation and retention.
— Encourage micro-behaviors: Focus on small, manageable actions that users can easily complete daily, building long-term engagement.
