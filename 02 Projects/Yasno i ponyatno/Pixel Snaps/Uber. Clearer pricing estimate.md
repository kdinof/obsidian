## Context
When Uber launched it tested showing a price range (e.g., $14-$20) for ride estimates. The idea was to give users a transparent view of potential fluctuations due to factors like traffic, demand, and time of day. While this introduced flexibility, Uber soon realized an unintended consequence of the design choice: **users were gravitating toward the top of the range** and **were anxious about paying that maximum value**.

This introduced #uncertainty into the decision-making process, as users weren’t sure how much they’d ultimately pay, causing many to hesitate or abandon their bookings altogether.

# Behavior tips
- #loss-aversion n played a major role when users disproportionately focused on the higher end of the price range.
- #anchoring also influenced behavior, as users would often anchor their expectations to the higher price, leading them to believe they were likely to pay more, which made Uber appear less affordable than it actually was.

**Broader Impact**
This shift to single pricing is now a **standard practice in ride-hailing apps** and many other services. Users generally feel more comfortable and are more likely to commit to a purchase when they have clarity about the costs upfront. The success of this A/B experiment highlights the importance of **perceived fairness** and **simplicity** in price presentation.
