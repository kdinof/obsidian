Day-to-day user behavior tips 

Now, on a day-to-day basis (I hope), I post my opinion as to why the experiment was successful based on user behavior biases and psychology. All my A/B experiment cases are taken from [abtest.design](https://abtest.design), since it’s already structured. So, in case one wants to dive deep into behind-the-scenes about the experiment results, please have a look at my short #pixel-snaps posts

#pixel-snaps will be only in english just to be helpful for more broader audience.

PX 1 • Blinkist • How your free trial works

The first #pixel-snaps is about widely spread subscription screen pattern that started from Blinkist experiment in 2021 year

The biggest #fear customers face when put in front of a free trial is forgetting to cancel the trial and getting charged.

This is part of what is described as [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Loss Aversion]]: a behavioral concept where, for most people, the pain associated with losing something is more significant than the pleasure associated with gaining something equivalent.

That is why 33% of the cancellations are done right after users start their trial.

In this case the #transparency would mean the answer to, “How am I never going to forget to cancel my subscription if it happens that I don’t like the app?”
