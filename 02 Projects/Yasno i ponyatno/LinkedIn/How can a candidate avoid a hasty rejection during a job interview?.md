Stand Out in the First 5 Minutes: how can candidates avoid a hasty rejection in an interview?  First impressions matter—make every second count!


Lately, I’ve been conducting many interviews as our hiring process is in full swing. This led me to explore the psychology of candidate selection, and I discovered a study https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joop.12118 that reveals how quickly interviewers (recruiters and hiring managers) decide whether to move forward with a candidate. Here are the key findings:  
• 30% of interviewers make a decision within the first 5 minutes.  
• 70% decide during or after the interview.

What influences the speed of decision-making?  
→ Structure of questions: When interviewers use a clear script and ask all candidates the same questions, they tend to spend more time on their decision.  
→ Small talk: Informal conversation at the beginning of the interview speeds up decision-making — this can work for or against you. We subconsciously tend to trust, a phenomenon known as the “halo effect” https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/halo-effect 
→ Standardization of evaluation: If interviewers have a clear rating scale for candidates, they take longer to decide and rely less on intuition.  
→ Candidate’s position in the interview schedule: The first 3-4 candidates are evaluated more thoroughly, but afterwards, decisions are made faster. 

Here are several tips for candidates to avoid an impulsive “no”:  
→ Make a strong first impression. An energetic tone and confidence work in your favor. Have a clear, rehearsed answer to “Tell me about yourself” and appear neat. This creates a positive “halo” around you within the first few minutes.  
→ Use small talk to your advantage. Interviewers often start with neutral questions like “How was your commute?” or “What do you think of our office?” Think of positive topics in advance to create a friendly atmosphere.  
→ Consider scheduling your interview after the initial rush. Early candidates tend to be evaluated more slowly, and later on, interviewers may speed up their decisions automatically — let the funnel warm up.  
→ Prepare your responses using the STAR method (Situation – Task – Action – Result) to communicate your experience clearly.  
→ DO NOT BE LATE. Simply don’t be late

For those hiring, a few self-checks are useful:  
→ Observe your own behavior during interviews. Is a “halo” forming around a candidate within the first 5 minutes?  
→ Consider how small talk might be influencing your judgment.  
→ Try using the same questions for all candidates to ensure a fair process.

In summary, we are all human with many subconscious processes at play. Even a little insight into how our minds work can help you hire better or ace your interview.
