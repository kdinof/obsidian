I want you to help with the development of the code for a Telegram bot. 

What should this Telegram bot do? 

The main task of the Telegram bot is to conduct user surveys, similar to the functionality of Google Forms, but within Telegram. It's important that, like in Google Forms, there are answers with multiple choices, yes/no options, and ratings on a scale from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10, etc. There will also be open-ended questions. For open-ended questions, users can respond with voice messages. 

So, the user responding to the survey can reply either in writing or with a voice message. The voice message should be transcribed, and all responses need to be stored in a file somewhere. 

There are two roles in this bot: 

1. Administrator - the person who creates the surveys. There should be a basic question builder that allows you to choose the type of question you want to ask: open-ended, multiple-choice, or a rating scale from 1 to 5. 

2. Respondent - a person who answers the survey. There should be a link to the survey that opens within the Telegram bot, and the user only sees that survey. They go through the questions, answer them, and ultimately, the responses are sent to a table where they are recorded and stored. 

Can you please help describe the overall process you see for assembling this bot in Telegram? Let's go!
