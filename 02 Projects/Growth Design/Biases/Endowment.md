# Summary

Russian: чувство владения

We feel a sense of **ownership and possession**. Not only do we not want to give up things that we own, but we attribute more value to them. This is called the **endowment effect** and it can play a huge part in marketing campaigns and sales.

But what if the shop assistant used a different strategy? What if he said: “_Hey, that’s a great TV._ _What do you think you’d enjoy watching on it most?”_ Suddenly, **you’d find yourself imagining what it would be like if you owned it.** You could finally watch football and see every detail. You’d probably invite a few friends over, have some beers, and have a great time. You love the idea. And surprisingly, it’s then hard to let it go. 
**Just the idea of possession can create the endowment effect. Make your customers imagine what it would be like to own your product** – how it will feel and what they can use it for.

The endowment effect is based on one of the most powerful behavioral principles out there – **[[02 Projects/Growth Design/Biases/Loss Aversion]].**

It was first described in Kahneman and Tversky’s [study](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Behavioral_Decision_Theory/Kahneman_Tversky_1979_Prospect_theory.pdf) in the late 1970s. To put it simply, it says that **we hate experiencing losses approximately twice as much as we like gains.** In other words, you would be twice as sad if you lost 50€ as you would be happy if you found the same amount.

This loss aversion paves the way for the endowment effect. **As we hate losing things, we attribute more value to them to compensate for their loss**. For example, [Carmon and Ariely famously showed](https://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersPI/Value%20Buyer%20and%20Seller.pdf) that people who won tickets for a basketball game were willing to sell them for much higher prices ($2,400 on average) than others were willing to buy them for ($175 on average). The tickets were worth so much more to them once they owned them.

If you can, **always let the customer try your product first**. Once the customers know what it’s like to use it on a daily basis, they will feel the value and won’t want to let it go.

Put the idea in their heads and make them imagine as vividly as possible what life with your product would look like.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Even the idea of ownership is enough to create the endowment effect.** Make your customers visualize what it would be like to own your product. They will have a hard time letting go of the idea.
- **Let the customer try your product/service first.** Once they can try it first hand, use it on a daily basis and see all its benefits, it will be much harder for them to let it go.
- **Show your customers that it’s already theirs and all they need to do is to use it.** Whether it’s a coupon or other benefit, when it’s already theirs, they will feel it’s a shame not to use it.
- **Give the customer a specific idea of how to use the benefit**. The clearer the idea, the easier it is to start to imagine what they could do with the product, so the feeling of possession gets stronger
- **Ask your customers questions.** It will trigger their imagination and the feeling of ownership will be even stronger.

- [PROSPECT THEORY: AN ANALYSIS OF DECISION UNDER RISK](https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Behavioral_Decision_Theory/Kahneman_Tversky_1979_Prospect_theory.pdf) The paper, "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk" by Kahneman and Tversky, presents Prospect Theory as an alternative to the Expected Utility Theory in decision-making under risk. It challenges the notion that people make choices based on the maximization of expected utility, showing instead that choices are influenced by potential gains or losses relative to a reference point, rather than final outcomes. The theory introduces the concept of decision weights, which differ from probabilities, and illustrates how people underweight probable outcomes compared to certain ones, leading to risk-averse or risk-seeking behaviors depending on the framing of choices as gains or losses.
- [Focusing on the Forgone: How Value Can Appear So Different to Buyers and Sellers](https://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersPI/Value%20Buyer%20and%20Seller.pdf) The research paper "Focusing on the Forgone: How Value Can Appear So Different to Buyers and Sellers" delves into the psychological differences in how buyers and sellers perceive the value of items, particularly tickets for events like NCAA basketball games. The core concept is that buyers and sellers focus on what they have to give up (money for buyers, the item or experience for sellers), influencing their price estimates. This perspective highlights the discrepancy between buying and selling prices, offering insights into consumer behavior and market dynamics. The studies presented support the idea that this focus on what is forgone significantly shapes the valuation process in transactions.

Если вещь пока не пренадлижит покупателю, например товар на полке в магазине, то можно создать впечатление от того, что будет, когда покупатель уже владеет этим товаром. Тут хороший пример рекламы любого продукта от apple.

Как через фото и сторителлинг создать чувство от вещей, которые продаются в Romy? Описание ткани, то, как она ощущается на теле? 

Ценность потери воспринимается в 2 раза сильнее, чем приобретения (того, чего ещё нет)
