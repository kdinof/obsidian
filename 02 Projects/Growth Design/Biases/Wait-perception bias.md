> In "How to Make Waiting More Bearable with Behavioral Economics," we dive into strategies to enhance customer experiences during inevitable wait times. It's all about engagement and perception—**keeping customers busy makes time fly by**, like Disney engaging visitors in queues or clinics pre-checking patients. **Occupying customers with tasks**, like unloading shopping carts or filling out forms, also helps. **Transparency is key; explaining wait times and reasons reduces frustration and uncertainty.** Remember, people dislike uncertainty—it triggers a cognitive bias making situations seem worse. So, engage, explain, and keep minds busy for a smoother wait!


# Summary

As they’re already engaged while waiting in line, they **feel like the attraction has already started**.

Another example of how to get people started can be seen in a walk-in clinic. While people were in the waiting room, waiting to be seen by a medical service provider,[ they were approached by the nurse first](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.487.3938&rep=rep1&type=pdf). The nurse recorded the patient’s name, symptoms and identified whether the patient should be checked by the doctor or a registered nurse

There are plenty of ways of doing this – letting the customers unload a cart while there are still people ahead in line, giving customers a menu to look at while waiting to be served, taking patients from the waiting room to an exam room to wait for the doctor there, or a voicemail greeting customers when they call, asking them to fill out paperwork before reaching the service agent.

At Houston airport, this issue was so big that[ passengers regularly filed complaints](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html) about the long waiting times. Executives noticed one thing – even though passengers were **waiting around 7 minutes** at the baggage claim, it took them just one minute to get there from their gates. 

And as (not only) behavioral economics research shows, [with an occupied mind, time feels like it goes faster.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685813/)

According to their results, music didn’t influence the perceived waiting time **unless the callers could choose the music according to their taste.** Giving people more than one option has been proven to [not only increase sales ](http://web.missouri.edu/~segerti/capstone/SingleOptionAversion.pdf)and [improve customer retention strategy](https://insidebe.com/articles/tips-to-increase-customer-retention-part-1/) but can help improve the overall customer experience of your service as well.

And the same thing applies when it comes to waiting. When customers need to wait, **you need to tell them why**.

Plus, there’s a thing in behavioral science called [fundamental attribution error](https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html) (also known as correspondence bias) – **we tend to draw conclusions about someone’s personality from their actions,** and we fail to consider the situation the person is in. 

The fact is, **any given reason is better than none**, as shown in [a famous psychological experiment](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-23568-001) from the late 70s. Researchers were exploring what it takes for people to be okay with someone cutting in line. They approached people waiting in line for a copy machine and asked them to let them use it first. 
 When providing no reason at all, only 60% of people let them cut in line. The percentage rose to 94% when they explained that they had an important meeting in 5 minutes and needed to make copies urgently. 
But they also tried a silly reason – “Do you mind if I use the xerox machine before you because I have to make copies?” And it truly is a silly reason – of course, everybody was waiting in line because they needed to make copies. But in this case, **93% of people let the researcher skip ahead.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-insidebe-com-articles-make-waiting-more-bearable-18d309a05d4#ef793a42-088d-474d-99b0-7acff82164b0)  

That way you eliminate your customers’ uncertainties. In behavioral economics, uncertainty is a well-known, hard-wired cognitive bias. **If people don’t know what’s happening, they feel endangered** and [tend to get out of such situations](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/ambiguity-uncertainty-aversion/). Not exactly the customer experience any business is looking for!

**Make your customers feel like whatever they came for has already started.** Even unloading a shopping cart or filling out paperwork while they’re waiting will make them feel the time is passing more quickly.
* **Keep your customers’ minds occupied.** Time feels like it runs faster when we have something to do.
* **Tell customers the reason why they are waiting**. Without knowing why, customers will blame you for their frustration and the waiting will seem even longer.
* **Remove customers’ uncertainties** by telling them how long something will take. Any uncertainty the customers may feel can frustrate them and make the whole experience worse.

# Digital implementations
---
- Questionaries, quizes or information while customer or user waiting something e.g. installation or set up completion.
- Transparent communication. Telling why they have to wait, be more transparent

- [Fundamental Attribution Error In Psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/fundamental-attribution.html) In other words, people have a [cognitive bias](https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-bias.html) to assume that a person’s actions depend on what “kind” of person that person is rather than on the social and environmental forces that influence the person.
