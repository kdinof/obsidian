# Summary

Let’s take a look at **reciprocity**. It’s a behavioral principle that says that [if somebody does something for us, we feel the urge to repay them.](https://insidebe.com/reports/reciprocity/) As [research ](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04131)shows, from an evolutionary point of view, it’s a handy behavior that has allowed us to function as a society, and as is often the case with evolution, to reproduce.

**The good example of how shop assistant impacts on buyers decision** 
Just the feeling that the assistant had spent 30 minutes trying to help Joe pick the best pair of jeans was enough to persuade him to buy. 
Why? Because he would feel bad not taking them after the assistant had spent half an hour picking the best pair. As you can see, just **the feeling that Joe had been given something** (this time, it was the help) was enough to persuade him to buy

_“**If you were in need, we would be there to help you**. You can help already today by sending an empty text worth 2 EUR to 848\. Thank you! League Against Cancer and O2.”_
And the results? This message **outperformed the original message by 55%.** They didn’t give people any gifts, just the feeling of reassurance that they’d be there if needed. **They gave their customers a feeling they had received something before they asked anything from them**. This brings us to the next point.

f you want your customers to do something (preferably to buy your product), the customers need to feel they have been given something before you roll out the offer. 
**The order is important. Give first, ask second**

When your customers feel like the deal you are offering is very generous, they will feel like they need to return the favor.


### Research on how much tips customers leave for a waiter
[Researchers tried to examine this ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00216.x)with a quite simple method – they instructed waiters to **offer customers candy at the end of the meal.** Not only did they hypothesize that the more chocolates they offered to customers, the bigger the tips they would receive, but they also thought about the **manner in which the candy was offered.**
In the control condition, the waiter didn’t offer customers any candy. In the first experimental condition, the waiter would offer a piece of chocolate when delivering the bill, which **increased the average tip size by 3.3%**. When that one piece of chocolate was replaced with two, **the tips increased by 14.1%.** 
In the third condition, they tried something different. The waiter gave the customers two pieces of candy as well, but **the manner in which it was delivered was changed**. First, the guests were offered a single piece. But as the waiter was walking away from the table, he stopped, turned back, and gave the guest another chocolate. **The mean tip in this condition increased by 21%.** 
Why were the results different even though the customers received two candies in both the second and third experimental conditions? They felt obligated to give something back as it felt like the waiter had given them extra candy, but also because it was **unexpected and personal.** 

When customers don’t see it coming, it feels like a nice gesture. [In another case study, ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1558489)customers were given surprise coupons when entering a shop. As it turned out, **they ended up spending 11% more** **on average** compared to those who had received the coupons in advance.

- **You don’t necessarily need to give customers something.** Just the feeling that they have can make a difference. Let them know you are there for them and willing to help them if needed.
* **Give first, ask later**. For customers to act, they need to feel that they have received something from you first.
* **Make your customers feel like the deal is a compromise.** They will feel more obliged when they see your goodwill.
* **Surprise your customers with something unexpected and personal.** A personalized gift is more valuable than a general one. And when customers don’t see it coming, it will look like a nice gesture

- В магазине должны быть крутые продавцы, которые не просто умеют продавать, а действительно хотят оказать крутую услугу. 
- Reciprocity не означает, что нужно давать пользователю именно какой-то подарок, чтобы получить что-то в замен. Иногда достаточно потраченного времени, внимания, совета или выгодная сделка
	- Выгодная сделка. Например после регистрации, продукт предлагает 50% скидки на первый месяц. Главное, чтобы оффер был персонализированный. Даже если сложно «выцепить» имя, достаточно сказать «Раз вы только что зарегистрировались в продукте, вот вам скидка т.к. мы хотим, чтобы вы попробовали продукт»
	- Потраченное время, как в примере с покупкой джинс.
