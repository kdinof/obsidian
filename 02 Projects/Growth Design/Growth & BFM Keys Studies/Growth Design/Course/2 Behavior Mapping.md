# Lesson Summary
---
User behaviors are defined by¬†`B¬†=¬†M¬∑A¬∑P`:
1. **Motivation**: the willpower to act.
2. **Ability**: the capacity to act.
3. **Prompt**: the timely cue to act.

When the desired user behavior isn‚Äôt happening, it‚Äôs likely because you‚Äôre below the¬†**Activation Threshold**

So you need to ask yourself 3 simple questions:
1. Motivation: Is the user motivated enough at that moment?
2. Ability: Does the user have the capabilities of performing the desired behavior? Your customer‚Äôs ability is a function of the scarcest of the five ability levers at that moment.
3. Prompt: Do you offer the user a clear nudge to act at the right moment? Without a prompt, there‚Äôs no action. Start small to lead customers to their ultimate outcome gradually.

Unless the incentive to change is compelling, people are more likely to stick to the default situation presented. This is also called the Status quo bias. It can be a powerful actor when trying to nudge users and shape behaviors.

That's a key element of creating memorable experiences. This "bizarreness effect" is also used by¬†_brain athletes_¬†to better memorize and remember different elements.
