# Chapter 1: Introduction — Why Great Ideas Don’t Work

## Case Studies



*   **Source:** J-PAL / IPA (Evidence Action)
*   **URL:** https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/community-chlorine-dispensers-better-health
*   **Year:** 2020 (Summary of research spanning 2003-2010 with ongoing impact)
*   **Insight:** Free, conveniently located chlorine dispensers at water sources dramatically increased water treatment adoption in Kenya compared to other methods.
*   **Takeaway:** Making desired behaviors easy and automatic by integrating them into existing routines (like water collection) effectively bridges the intention-action gap for health outcomes.

*   **Source:** Dumbo Design
*   **URL:** https://dumbo.design/en/insights/behavioral-intentions/
*   **Year:** 2021
*   **Insight:** User behavior online often follows patterns like Act (specific goal), Understand (deepen knowledge), or Explore (browse), influencing how they interact with digital products.
*   **Takeaway:** Designing UX flows aligned with the user's primary intention (Act, Understand, Explore) reduces friction and helps bridge the gap between wanting information/action and achieving it.



*   **Source:** Oyibo, K., & Vassileva, J. (Information Journal / MDPI)
*   **URL:** https://people.duke.edu/~ldbaker/classes/uxresearch/Relationship_between_Perceived.pdf (Accessible via Duke server, originally published in Information 2021, 12(9), 365; https://doi.org/10.3390/info12090365)
*   **Year:** 2021
*   **Insight:** In a fitness app context, perceived usefulness and aesthetics were more strongly linked to users' receptiveness to persuasive features (like goal-setting, rewards) than perceived usability or credibility.
*   **Takeaway:** To bridge the intention-action gap in behavior change apps, prioritize making the core value proposition clear (usefulness) and appealing (aesthetics) over just ease of use, as these drive adoption of persuasive elements.



*   **Source:** Scott H. Young (Medium)
*   **URL:** https://scotthyoung.medium.com/the-action-intention-gap-af90283ea0ed
*   **Year:** 2019
*   **Insight:** The primary reason goals fail isn't lack of talent or luck, but the gap between what we intend to do and what we actually do (the action-intention gap).
*   **Takeaway:** Recognizing this gap is the first step; bridging it requires strategies beyond just setting intentions, focusing on execution and overcoming procrastination or lack of follow-through.



*   **Source:** Komodo Digital
*   **URL:** https://www.komododigital.co.uk/insights/user-experience-design-action-intent/
*   **Year:** Undated (Accessed 2025)
*   **Insight:** UI design choices (color, shape, placement, language) act as contextual cues that significantly influence whether a user acts on their intent.
*   **Takeaway:** Bridge the intention-action gap in UX by designing intuitive interfaces that guide users clearly, using elements like action-oriented language (e.g., "Start My Free Trial") and considering visual hierarchy based on user scanning patterns (F/Z shapes).




## Experiments



*   **Source:** Brand, B. M. (Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services)
*   **URL:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.104179
*   **Year:** 2025 (Published online Dec 2024)
*   **Insight:** Laboratory experiments (vs. surveys) found that providing sustainability information via QR codes linking to videos improved product evaluation and purchase intention for textiles compared to static hangtags; AR also showed potential in narrowing the gap by increasing willingness-to-pay among actual buyers.
*   **Takeaway:** The *method* of information delivery impacts the intention-action gap; richer, digital formats (like video via QR) can be more effective than static text in influencing sustainable choices in a realistic setting.



*   **Source:** Valentine, L., Hinton, J. D. X., Bajaj, K., et al. (NPJ Digital Medicine / PMC)
*   **URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12041226/
*   **Year:** 2025 (Published online Apr 2025)
*   **Insight:** A meta-analysis of 92 RCTs on mental health apps found they significantly improved clinical outcomes, but there was no significant association between the number of persuasive design principles used and app efficacy or user engagement.
*   **Takeaway:** While mental health apps can be effective, simply adding more persuasive design features doesn't guarantee better engagement or outcomes; the *quality* and *context* of implementation likely matter more, and standardized engagement metrics are needed to better understand this relationship and bridge the intention-action gap in app usage.



*   **Source:** Yang, Z., Li, J., & Liu, X. (Frontiers in Psychology)
*   **URL:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1586176
*   **Year:** 2025 (Published online Apr 2025)
*   **Insight:** A meta-analysis of 92 studies (47k+ participants) confirmed a moderate relationship (r=0.41) between exercise intention and behavior, finding that action planning, coping planning, and especially action control mediate this relationship.
*   **Takeaway:** To bridge the intention-action gap for exercise (and likely other behaviors), interventions should focus on strengthening action control (the ability to self-monitor and regulate behavior towards a goal) alongside planning.



*   **Source:** Lukka, L., Vesterinen, M., Salonen, A., et al. (BMC Health Services Research)
*   **URL:** https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-025-12641-9
*   **Year:** 2025 (Published online Apr 2025)
*   **Insight:** Applying a "user journey method" to track usage across *all* elements of a digital mental health intervention (recruitment, website, assessment, software, questionnaires, support) helps pinpoint specific barriers and dropout points, revealing issues beyond just the core software.
*   **Takeaway:** To bridge the intention-action gap in digital interventions, don't just focus on the core product; map and measure the entire user journey to identify and fix friction points across the whole service experience, from discovery to completion.



*   **Source:** Pan, L., Pan, X., Mo, X., & Xia, T. (Behavioral Sciences (Basel) / PMC)
*   **URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11200381/
*   **Year:** 2024 (Published online Jun 2024)
*   **Insight:** Combining Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this study found that satisfaction (driven by usefulness, confirmation, social presence) and TPB factors (attitude, norms, perceived control) significantly predict willingness to continue using online sports videos.
*   **Takeaway:** To bridge the intention-action gap for continued use of digital health/fitness tools, focus not only on initial attitudes and perceived control but also on post-use satisfaction, ensuring the experience meets expectations and provides perceived value and social connection.




## Frameworks/Tools



*   **Source:** Roy, K. (Medium / Bootcamp)
*   **URL:** https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/turning-intent-into-action-how-the-create-action-funnel-empowers-ux-design-c26e8ba98515
*   **Year:** 2024
*   **Insight:** Stephen Wendel's CREATE Action Funnel (Cue, Reaction, Evaluation, Ability, Timing, Experience) provides a step-by-step guide for designing experiences that move users from intention to action.
*   **Takeaway:** Use the CREATE framework to diagnose where users drop off (e.g., weak Cue, negative Evaluation, lack of Ability) and design interventions (like clear prompts, reduced friction, timely nudges) to bridge the intention-action gap effectively.



*   **Source:** Jacob-Puchalska, A. (UX Collective / Medium - Summary of Wendel's book)
*   **URL:** https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-behavior-change-applying-psychology-and-behavioral-economics-e30d0fadb95d
*   **Year:** 2020 (Article summarizing 2020 book edition)
*   **Insight:** Stephen Wendel's book "Designing for Behavior Change" provides frameworks (like CREATE Action Funnel, mentioned previously) specifically to help designers address the intention-action gap by applying psychology and behavioral economics.
*   **Takeaway:** Wendel's work offers structured approaches for designers to understand *why* users fail to act on intentions and design products that facilitate behavior change ethically and effectively.



*   **Source:** Behavioural Insights Team (via ModelThinkers)
*   **URL:** https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/east-framework
*   **Year:** Framework developed ~2012, widely used currently (Accessed 2025)
*   **Insight:** The EAST framework suggests making desired behaviors Easy, Attractive, Social, and Timely (EAST) to effectively nudge people towards action.
*   **Takeaway:** Apply EAST principles to bridge the intention-action gap: simplify choices (Easy), grab attention (Attractive), leverage social norms (Social), and prompt at the right moment (Timely).



*   **Source:** Yildiz, B. (UX Collective / Medium - Referencing Wendel)
*   **URL:** https://uxdesign.cc/enriching-ux-with-behavioural-economics-d7bfd477575d
*   **Year:** 2020
*   **Insight:** This article highlights using behavioral economics in UX, suggesting adding a **Behavioral Map** (detailing micro-actions) to user journeys and using Wendel's **DECIDE** framework (Define, Explore, Craft, Implement, Determine, Evaluate) for designing and testing interventions.
*   **Takeaway:** Combine Behavioral Mapping with frameworks like CREATE (for diagnosis) and DECIDE (for intervention design/testing) to systematically address the intention-action gap by breaking down the desired action and designing targeted solutions.



*   **Source:** Kaley, A. & Gibbons, S. (Nielsen Norman Group)
*   **URL:** https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-strategy/
*   **Year:** 2022
*   **Insight:** A UX Strategy, comprising a Vision, Goals/Measures, and a Plan, provides a roadmap for improving user experience over time, ensuring user-centered insights are integrated with business strategy.
*   **Takeaway:** While not directly about the intention-action gap, a clear UX strategy is foundational; by defining a user-centered vision and measurable goals, it creates the context and drive to address such gaps systematically rather than through ad-hoc fixes.
