Your note reflects a key idea from behavioral science, particularly as explained in **Astrid Groenewegen’s work** on behavior design: our **brains use heuristics**—mental shortcuts—to simplify complex decisions. These shortcuts are helpful most of the time, but they come with a side-effect: **cognitive biases**.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

### 🧠 Heuristics → Biases

- **Heuristics** are automatic, fast rules of thumb that our brains rely on to make decisions quickly.
- They're necessary because we encounter **too much information** to process everything analytically.
- But because heuristics skip over detailed analysis, they can lead to **systematic errors in thinking**—these are known as **cognitive biases**.

---

### 👁️‍🗨️ Subjective Social Reality

- Each person processes information through their own **unique lens**: shaped by upbringing, culture, context, previous experiences, and current emotions.
- This processing creates what Astrid calls a **“subjective social reality”**—a personal version of the world that may differ from objective reality or others’ perceptions.
- In essence, **we don't see things as they are, but as we are**.

---

### 💡 In Practice

When designing for behavior, this concept is crucial. You can’t assume that people will behave “rationally” or see your product the way you do. Instead, you must **design for how people actually perceive and process reality**—which means accounting for their biases and mental shortcuts.

---

Would you like a visual or example to make this even clearer in the context of product or behavior design?

##### You said:

yes

###### ChatGPT said:

Perfect! Let’s go with both a **visual metaphor** and a **real-world product design example** to bring this idea to life.

### 🎨 **Visual Metaphor: The Funhouse Mirror**

Imagine walking through a **funhouse of mirrors**.

- Each mirror is a **heuristic**—a way your brain tries to reflect reality quickly.
- But none of the mirrors show a *perfect* reflection.
- Some make you look tall, short, stretched, or squished—that’s your **cognitive bias** at work.
- Over time, **you start believing these distorted reflections are real**, forming your **subjective social reality**.

Now imagine every person has their own funhouse—unique mirrors, different distortions, based on their life experiences. That's how varied and biased our perceptions are.

---

### 💻 **Real-World Product Example: Facebook Likes**

#### What the platform shows:

- A simple number of likes.

#### What users perceive (subjective reality):

- “People value me” (social validation heuristic).
- “My post is worth something only if it gets likes” (availability bias + anchoring).

#### Side effect:

- Emotional dependency, social comparison, and even anxiety—*driven by distorted perceptions*, not just the actual product.

Even though the system just counts likes, the **heuristics and biases** cause users to interpret them in dramatically personal ways. Each person forms a **subjective meaning** from a simple signal.

---

### 🧭 Design Implication

When designing behavior-change products:

- Don’t assume users will respond “logically.”
- Map their **cognitive landscape**: what shortcuts do they use? What meanings do they attach?
- **Design for perception**, not just for function.

---

Would you like to relate this to your own product or project? I can help map heuristics and biases that might shape your users' experience.

##### You said:

What are difference between heuristics and cognitive biases?

###### ChatGPT said:

Great question—this distinction is subtle but important, especially in behavioral design. Here's a simple breakdown:

---

### 🧠 **Heuristics vs. Cognitive Biases**

| **Heuristics** | **Cognitive Biases** |
| --- | --- |
| **Mental shortcuts** or rules of thumb our brain uses to make decisions quickly. | **Systematic errors in thinking** that occur when heuristics go wrong or are used inappropriately. |
| Can be **helpful**—they save time and effort in decision-making. | Are often **unhelpful**—they lead to distorted judgment and poor decisions. |
| Example: *“If something is expensive, it must be high quality.”* (price-quality heuristic) | Example: *Thinking an expensive product is better even when reviews say otherwise.* (confirmation bias + anchoring) |
| Often **adaptive and efficient**; they work well in many situations. | Are the **side effects** or **failures** of those heuristics under certain conditions. |

---

### 💡 Simple Analogy:

Think of **heuristics as mental tools**. Like a Swiss Army knife—they're fast and handy.

But when you use the wrong tool for the wrong job (like using a bottle opener to screw in a bolt), you end up with a **cognitive bias**—a mistake in thinking or judgment.

---

### 👀 In Product Design:

- **Heuristic use is predictable**, and you can design around it (e.g., default settings, familiar layouts).
- **Biases are the blind spots**—if ignored, they lead users to misunderstand or misuse your product.

So as a designer, you:

1. **Leverage heuristics** to guide behavior effortlessly.
2. **Mitigate biases** that might distort perceptions or choices.

##### You said:

can you provide a list of heuristics and relations to cognitive biases?

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here's a **cheat sheet** of common **heuristics** along with the **cognitive biases** they often lead to, especially useful in behavior design and product thinking:

### 🧠 Heuristics & Their Related Cognitive Biases

| **Heuristic** | **Description** | **Related Cognitive Bias(es)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Availability Heuristic** | We judge how likely something is based on how easily examples come to mind. | • **Availability Bias** – Overestimating events we've recently seen or heard about (e.g., plane crashes).   • **Recency Effect** – Giving weight to recent info over older data. |
| **Representativeness Heuristic** | We judge the probability of something based on how similar it is to a stereotype. | • **Base Rate Neglect** – Ignoring statistical reality in favor of stereotype-based judgment.   • **Gambler’s Fallacy** – Believing past random events affect future ones. |
| **Anchoring Heuristic** | We rely heavily on the first piece of info (the "anchor") when making decisions. | • **Anchoring Bias** – Getting stuck on initial numbers (e.g., pricing).   • **Framing Effect** – Decisions change depending on how options are presented. |
| **Affect Heuristic** | We rely on our emotions rather than facts to make decisions. | • **Negativity Bias** – Negative emotions have a stronger impact than positive ones.   • **Risk Aversion** – Fear leads to avoiding potential losses more than seeking gains. |
| **Recognition Heuristic** | If one option is more familiar or recognizable, we assume it’s better or more accurate. | • **Familiarity Bias** – Preferring what we already know.   • **Mere Exposure Effect** – Repeated exposure increases liking. |
| **Simplicity Heuristic (Cognitive Ease)** | We prefer options that are easier to understand or process. | • **Fluency Effect** – Easier-to-process info is perceived as more truthful or appealing.   • **Default Bias** – Choosing the path of least resistance (default settings). |
| **Authority Heuristic** | We trust authority figures and their opinions, often without question. | • **Authority Bias** – Valuing opinions of authority more, regardless of validity. |
| **Social Proof Heuristic** | We look to others' behavior to guide our own, especially in uncertainty. | • **Bandwagon Effect** – Adopting beliefs or actions because others do.   • **Conformity Bias** – Aligning with group norms even against better judgment. |

### 💡 Tip for Designers:

Use **heuristics to reduce friction** and guide users subtly (e.g., defaults, testimonials, social cues), and **design around biases** to prevent misjudgments (e.g., avoid anchoring people with arbitrary price comparisons).
