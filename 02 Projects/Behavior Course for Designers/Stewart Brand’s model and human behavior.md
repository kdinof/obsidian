Stewart Brand’s model isn’t a hard-and-fast taxonomy, so “human behavior and biases” can be viewed as spanning multiple layers rather than fitting neatly into just one. Here’s one way to think about it:

**1. Nature (deepest layer)**  
Some core aspects of our behavior—such as fight-or-flight responses or universal biases like loss aversion—have roots in our evolutionary biology. These are the slowest to change because they’re shaped by millennia of human evolution. In Brand’s terms, that puts them close to the Nature layer.

**2. Culture (one layer above)**  
Many behaviors and biases are embedded in shared norms, values, and belief systems—things that define how we collectively see the world. Cultural biases (e.g., stereotypes, attitudes toward gender roles, etc.) tend to evolve from generation to generation, which is slower than changes in fashion or commerce, but faster than changing the underlying biology. That places them near Culture.

**3. The faster-moving layers**  
At the same time, many “surface-level” behaviors (like this year’s consumer preferences, spending habits, social media trends, etc.) will feel the fast pulse of Fashion and Commerce. People’s day-to-day behaviors shift quickly as they respond to new trends or market changes—even though deeper biases and instincts remain anchored in slower layers.

In other words:

- **Innate or universal biases** (rooted in our physiology and evolutionary psychology) are close to _Nature._
- **Culturally acquired biases** (shaped by upbringing, social norms, religion, etc.) reside mainly in _Culture._
- **Behavior that’s more transient** (reacting to trends, marketing, media buzz) appears in the outer, more rapidly changing layers like _Fashion_ and _Commerce._

So rather than saying “human behavior and biases” belong to just one layer, it’s more accurate to picture them as _threads running through several layers,_ from our biological foundation (Nature), through our social and cultural context (Culture), all the way out to our fast-shifting engagement with the modern world (Fashion and Commerce).
