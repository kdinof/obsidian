# Notes

The first ingredient of successful Behavioural Design may hurt a bit. If you want to design behaviour, it isn’t about you or your product, brand or plan. Well, at least not in the first place. It’s also all about the people you are trying to influence. Most of the time, marketeers, business owners, executives or policymakers are thinking inside-out – they look at their brand, product, service or policy, and wonder how they might convince people to embrace it. They come up with brand positioning, unique selling points and (product) benefits. In this book I would like to propose the opposite approach: outside-in thinking. Outside-in thinking takes the humans behind the customer, citizen, employee as a starting point, and tries to gain a deep understanding of their goals, needs, barriers and hopes. These are often not logical but psychological.

Okay, let's delve deeper into the concepts of inside-out and outside-in perspectives, drawing from the sources you've provided. It's a critical distinction that underlies much of what we've been discussing, and truly understanding it will help you grasp why so many well-intentioned ideas fail to gain traction.

**Inside-Out Perspective:**

- **Starting with the Solution** The inside-out perspective begins with the organization's perspective— its product, service, brand, or policy. It's about what the organization has to offer and how they can convince people to accept it. This is a common approach for marketers, business owners, executives, and policymakers. They often ask themselves how they can get people to embrace what they've already developed.
- **Focus on Features and Benefits:** An inside-out approach tends to emphasize brand positioning, unique selling points, and product or service benefits. It focuses on the features that the product or service has to offer, without considering the needs or goals of the user, or their real [[Context]]. This approach assumes that the value of the offering is self-evident.
- **Assumes Rationality** An inside-out perspective often assumes that people are rational actors who will make decisions based on the logical benefits of a product or service. It often ignores or downplays the role of psychology, emotions, and habits in decision-making. This can lead to the design of products that people _should_ want, but often _don't_.
- **Example:** A company might focus on the technical specifications of a new smartphone, highlighting its processing speed, camera resolution, and battery life. They might assume that these features alone will entice customers to purchase the device, failing to understand the actual needs, anxieties, and motivations of their target audience.

**Outside-In Perspective:**

- **Starting with the Human** The outside-in perspective takes a radically different approach. It starts with the people you are trying to influence—the customer, citizen, or employee. It seeks a deep understanding of their goals, needs, barriers, and hopes. The focus is on the human being first, not the product. The outside-in approach emphasizes empathy for the user.
- **Focus on Psychology** This perspective recognizes that human behavior is often driven by psychological factors, not just logic. Decisions are based on subconscious forces that keep people in their current patterns of behavior or move them to new behaviors. These forces are often not logical, but they have a major impact on choices.
- **Understanding the "Job-to-Be-Done"** A key element of outside-in thinking is the concept of "jobs to be done." It emphasizes what a person is trying to achieve when they "hire" a product or service. This goes beyond simple functionality. It also encompasses the social and emotional aspects of the task.
- **[[Context]] ([[Context Bias]])  Matters** The outside-in perspective emphasizes that context is as important as the product or service itself. The value that people experience depends on the circumstances in which they encounter your offering. You can make something objectively the same feel subjectively more valuable.
- **Example:** Instead of focusing on the technical features of a smartphone, a company using an outside-in perspective would first try to understand how people actually use their phones in their daily lives. What "jobs" are they trying to get done? Do they need help communicating with loved ones, managing their work, or staying informed? By understanding these needs, the company can design a phone that genuinely provides value to its target audience, both functionally and emotionally.

**Why is Outside-In Thinking so Important?**

1. **Avoiding Assumptions** An inside-out approach is often based on assumptions about what people want. These assumptions can be completely wrong. Outside-in thinking, on the other hand, is built on data gained through research and observation.
2. **Creating Genuine Value:** By starting with the human perspective, you have a greater chance of creating something that truly solves a problem, fulfills a need, or enhances someone's life. An outside-in approach forces you to think about how to add human value. This makes it less likely you will find a nonexistent problem to fit your solution.
3. **Unlocking Psychological Value** Psychological value refers to how people _experience_ something, not just what it is. It is about making something subjectively more valuable even if it is objectively the same. This is often done by addressing pain points and anxieties. It is a form of value creation that is often overlooked, but that can lead to considerable success.
4. **Addressing System 1:** Because our System 1 makes 96% of our decisions, effective influence requires that we design with system 1 in mind. Outside-in thinking takes this into account by addressing the subconscious forces that drive human behavior. It is not enough to provide facts or figures to System 2.
5. **Overcoming Inertia** People tend to stick to what's familiar, even if it's not ideal. By understanding the forces that maintain current behavior, you can design interventions that help people transition to a desired behavior.
6. **Effective Communication** By understanding people's pains and struggles, you can craft communication that truly resonates. When people feel that they have been understood, they will be more receptive to your message.
7. **Improved Innovation** Outside-in thinking helps companies innovate in more meaningful ways. It allows for continuous improvement, based on the actual needs of customers. It is an ongoing process of defining, developing, and delivering until a solution is found that triggers a desired behavior.

**The SUE | Influence Framework and the Outside-In Perspective:**

The SUE | Influence Framework is a practical tool for applying an outside-in perspective. It encourages you to:

- **Understand Thinking:** Delve into how people arrive at decisions, recognizing the influence of System 1 and System 2.
- **Identify Behavior:** Uncover the forces that drive human behavior, including pains, gains, anxieties, and comforts.
- **Unlock Opportunities:** Find opportunities for behavior change by addressing the underlying motivations and barriers that people face.

The framework is explicitly designed to help you create interventions that are human-centered, not product-centered. It helps to get you out of an inside-out frame of mind. It aims to help you see the world from the perspective of the people you are trying to influence.

**In Summary:**

The difference between inside-out and outside-in perspectives is a fundamental one. Inside-out thinking starts with the organization and its offerings, while outside-in thinking starts with the human being and their needs. By adopting an outside-in approach, you can create products, services, and policies that are more likely to be successful because they resonate with people on a deeper, more meaningful level. The SUE method can help you to shift from an inside-out perspective to an outside-in perspective.

That was a lot of information, but hopefully, it has clarified the distinction between inside-out and outside-in perspectives. Now that you have a better understanding of this fundamental difference, what would you like to explore next? Would you like me to quiz you on what we just discussed or should we investigate how the SUE | SWAC tool helps you create effective interventions?

Although the **Outside-in approach** is generally praised for being user-focused and increasing success, there are situations where the **Inside-out approach** can actually be more suitable or advantageous.

Here's when an **Inside-out approach** can be better:

### 1. **Strong Technical Advantage or Unique Expertise**
- **Reasoning**:  
    When your product or company has a unique technology or expertise that sets you far ahead of competitors, focusing on your internal strengths (inside-out) can exploit and expand your competitive edge quickly.
- **Example**:  
    Tesla initially capitalized on their battery technology to dominate the electric car market.

### 2. **Highly Regulated or Specialized Markets**

- **Reasoning**:  
    In fields like pharmaceuticals, finance, or complex software solutions, expert-driven development might initially be more important than customer-driven insight due to technical complexities or regulatory restrictions.

### 3. **When Establishing a Brand or Identity**

- **Reasoning**:  
    If building a strong, consistent brand identity or cultural image, starting from internal values and vision may provide clarity and authenticity before focusing on external user perceptions.

### 4. **When You’re Leading Market Innovation**

- **Reasoning**:  
    In scenarios where customers don’t yet fully understand their own needs (e.g., radical new technologies or innovations), an inside-out visionary perspective might be necessary to push the market forward (e.g., Apple with the iPhone).

### 4. **Highly Regulated Industries**

- **Reasoning**:  
    In finance, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, or similar heavily regulated sectors, it may be crucial first to comply with regulatory frameworks or requirements, which naturally leads to an inside-out starting point.

### 5. **When Incremental Improvement is Preferred**

- **Reasoning**:  
    When incremental improvements on existing successful products are essential for customer retention or competitive advantage, inside-out development (building upon existing strengths) makes practical and financial sense.

### 5. **Limited Resources and Fast Decision-making**

- **Reasoning**:  
    If resources (time, money, staffing) are limited, extensive outside-in research can be challenging to implement. Companies might rely on internal strengths, existing knowledge, or gut feeling to move quickly and decisively.

### 📌 Quick Overview (for reference):

|Scenario|Inside-Out Advantage|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Unique Technical Strength|Leveraging internal expertise (AI, patent, innovation)||
|Highly Specialized Solutions|Pharmaceutical development, advanced software platforms||
|Brand Identity|When creating brand positioning, culture, or unique vision||
|Market Shaping Innovations|Innovations ahead of explicit customer demand (e.g., first iPhone)||
|Regulated Sectors|Finance, healthcare (prioritizing compliance over user input initially)||
|Incremental Improvements & Fast Decisions|Resource-limited contexts; fast incremental improvements||
