Empathy: Design thinkers can imagine the world from multiple perspectives, including those of colleagues, clients, end users, and current and prospective customers2 . By adopting a "people first" approach, they can envision solutions that are inherently desirable and meet both explicit and latent needs2 . Great design thinkers are also highly observant, noticing details that others might miss2 .

Integrative Thinking: While the term "Integrative Thinking" isn't used as a heading in the "A Design Thinker's Personality Profile" section, the description of empathy suggests an element of this. The ability to imagine the world from multiple perspectives—colleagues, clients, end users, and customers—and to understand their varied needs and preferences implies an ability to synthesize these different viewpoints2 . Design thinking itself is later described as spurring us to take an integrative approach to developing new strategies or ideas, contrasting it with more siloed approaches in traditional ideation processes3 . The task of a design thinker is to bring all the phases together in one unified solution, breaking through silos between researchers, creatives, and strategic thinkers4 .

Optimism: Design thinkers generally believe that if a problem exists, at least one potential solution is better than the existing alternatives5 . This inherent belief in the possibility of improvement and better outcomes suggests an underlying sense of optimism.

Experimentalism: Significant innovations rarely come from small, incremental adjustments5 . Design thinkers embrace experimentalism by posing questions and exploring constraints in creative ways that can lead to entirely new directions5 . Their approach often involves iterative trial and error to learn something new with each attempt, rather than just validating preconceived notions6 . Prototyping, as discussed later in the "HBR" excerpts, is a key aspect of this experimental mindset, allowing for testing and radical changes based on user feedback7 .

Collaboration: The increasing complexity of products, services, and experiences has shifted away from the idea of the lone creative genius towards the importance of the enthusiastic interdisciplinary collaborator5 . The best design thinkers don't just work alongside other disciplines; many possess significant experience in more than one field8 . For example, IDEO employs individuals with backgrounds in engineering and marketing, anthropology and industrial design, and architecture and psychology8 . Design thinking builds alignment within teams as insights are translated into design criteria, moving the team towards convergence on what truly matters to users9 .
