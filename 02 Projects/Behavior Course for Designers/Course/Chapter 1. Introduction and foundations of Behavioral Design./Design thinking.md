==Design thinking is a methodology that infuses all aspects of innovation with a human-centered design philosophy. This means that at the heart of design thinking is a deep understanding, gained through direct observation, of what individuals desire and require in their lives.== It also involves understanding their preferences regarding how products are made, packaged, marketed, sold, and supported. Essentially, design thinking places people at the forefront of the innovation process.

This approach is considered a modern continuation of the innovative methods employed by figures like Thomas Edison. Edison, while famous for inventing the electric lightbulb, also dedicated significant attention to the needs and preferences of those who would use it. His innovation process was characterized by extensive trial and error, not to confirm existing ideas, but to learn something new with each attempt. Edison's work blended artistic creativity, practical skills, scientific understanding, business acumen, and a keen awareness of customers and markets. Design thinking inherits this tradition, utilizing the designer's sensitivity and techniques.

==At its core, design thinking is a discipline focused on aligning people's needs with what is technologically possible and what a sound business strategy can transform into customer value and market opportunities==. Similar to Edison's meticulous innovation process, design thinking often requires significant effort and dedication.

Historically, design was often relegated to a late stage in product development, where designers would primarily focus on the aesthetic appeal of an already developed idea or on enhancing brand perception through advertising. While this approach contributed to market growth in certain sectors like consumer electronics and automotive, it largely remained an afterthought in many industries. However, with the expanding scope of innovation to include human-centered processes and services alongside products, companies are now looking to designers to generate the initial ideas themselves, rather than just refining existing ones.

In essence, design thinking is a method for addressing people's needs and desires in a way that is both technologically feasible and strategically viable for a business. This can be seen in various applications, such as the collaboration between Kaiser Permanente employees and IDEO to redesign nursing shift changes. Through close observation, brainstorming, and rapid prototyping, they developed new procedures and software that significantly improved information exchange, resulting in more nursing time, better patient care, and a more satisfied nursing staff. Another example is Shimano's partnership with IDEO to create the "Coasting" brand concept, which aimed to introduce a new category of easy-to-use bicycles, accompanied by new retail strategies and a public relations campaign to promote safe cycling.

Design thinking can be particularly impactful in human-centered activities. While the stereotype of a design thinker might involve a certain aesthetic, the reality is that many individuals outside of traditional design professions possess a natural aptitude for design thinking, which can be developed with the right experiences. Key characteristics of design thinkers include empathy—the ability to understand the world from various perspectives; integrative thinking—the capacity to synthesize seemingly contradictory aspects of a problem into novel solutions; optimism—the belief that a better solution exists; experimentalism—a willingness to explore constraints creatively and in new directions; and collaboration—the ability to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams.

It's important to recognize that design thinking is not solely focused on creating physical products but is equally applicable to improving services and processes by taking a human-centered approach. Furthermore, while technology plays a role in accelerating design thinking methods, the core principles remain focused on understanding and meeting human needs. Design thinking is intended to support both the exploration of ideas and their eventual implementation. Ultimately, design thinking offers a human-centered, creative, iterative, and practical pathway to innovation, aimed at solving problems that are fundamentally about people and their needs.
