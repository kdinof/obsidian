Uncertainty is a situation when your customer has incomplete or missing information. A situation when their questions, concerns, and fears aren‚Äôt answered.

> When your customers are uncertain about anything (and we mean literally anything), they start asking questions. And questions prevent customers from buying.


**üí° Aha moment:**¬†Do your best to identify what customers‚Äô questions and concerns are and tackle them head-on before they have a chance to impact their decisions.

Often, an uncertain outcome feels¬†[worse than a certain negative outcome](https://jonahberger.com/books/the-catalyst/).

Uncertainty can prevent people from getting something they want. And by not addressing customers‚Äô uncertainties, companies miss out on conversions they could otherwise get
**As a result, they‚Äôll avoid situations that cause this feeling, abandon the buying process and leave dissatisfied.**

You‚Äôre probably thinking this looks pretty bleak. So is there hope? Yes! When you ask customers to do something or take on something new,¬†[it‚Äôs important to address all their major concerns](https://insidebe.com/articles/make-waiting-more-bearable/)¬†before these concerns have a chance to stop them in their tracks.

To put it bluntly: your offer can have a hundred benefits,¬†**but if there‚Äôs one concern or question to which the customer doesn‚Äôt get the answer, they may not take you upon it.**

As you can see below they don‚Äôt solely focus on the benefits (ad-free, multiple screens, option to download) but alleviate potential concerns, such as whether a user can cancel at any time and won‚Äôt be charged without being notified first, by putting them front and center in their registration funnel.

Since uncertainty is widespread, it means that before you start thinking of ways to motivate customers to engage with you or to buy from you, you have to [begin by understanding their main uncertainties and dealing with them.](https://insidebe.com/articles/understand-your-customers-barriers/) [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/the-impact-of-uncertainty-on-customer-behavior-inside-be-18d118e1589#686f873f-6867-4198-8b53-d671a8868583)

>* **Don‚Äôt just broadcast benefits, understand reservations.** In the case of the bank, the uncertainty was not knowing how to take advantage of the different features of the apps (and what it meant). The company could push these benefits for years to no avail; it took understanding what the problem was to fix it.
> * **Check your message for clarity.** Friends, family members, first dates, anyone can be your guinea pig. See how they interact with your landing page, job posting, or checkout page. Do they understand what you want them to do and how? Is your message correctly understood? Does it speak to not just the value but also possible concerns and reservations? Mark down the additional questions they have ‚Äì those are the ones you need to answer.
> * **Address your customers‚Äô uncertainties at the right time.** Think about where in their decision-making process a customer would benefit from seeing the choices other people made. Is it before they even choose a product, or later in the sales funnel (as in the case of ZARA)?
> * **Be transparent about trepidation.** If there‚Äôs an elephant in the room, omitting it from your communication won‚Äôt make it go away. It will make people pause in their tracks. Commitment concerns are a major deal breaker so make sure you always answer the question: how can I step away from it if I don‚Äôt like it?
