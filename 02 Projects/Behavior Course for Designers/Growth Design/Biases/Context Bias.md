## Context is Your Superweapon

TheÂ **environment**Â in which we make decisions has an enormous impact on the outcome of the decisions we make. In ourÂ [online masterclass](https://insidebe.com/online-courses/introduction-to-behavioral-economics-in-marketing/), Rory Sutherland gives the example of the yogurt companyÂ _Danone_Â who were desperate to put their yogurt drink in the milk aisle because it had the highest traffic in the supermarket.

Although this was a very rational approach, the problem was the context: it was placed alongside regular milk, which was close to half the price, making the yogurt seem far too expensive. They had to relook at the context. So they tested putting their product in the premium yogurt section instead. Suddenly, it didnâ€™t look like expensive milk, but a well-priced yogurt.

Think about it.Â **The product itself or its price didnâ€™t change.**Â However, theÂ **perception**Â of it did.Â 

**ðŸ’¡ Aha moment:**Â A slightÂ **change of context**Â can deliver the same result as if you had changed the product itself. But at a much lower cost.

> *If thereâ€™s one thing you shouldnâ€™t overlook when it comes to consumer behavior, itâ€™s the decision-making context. When you understand it, you can dramatically improve your marketing, sales, and even customer experience.*


Thatâ€™s how the human brains work â€“Â [we automatize certain decisions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2018.1459314)Â based on past experience and when we find ourselves in the same situation again, to save time and energyÂ **we subconsciously read the cues from the environment**Â (Iâ€™m in the store, in the alley with milk) and decide intuitively. Such intuitive shortcuts are calledÂ **heuristics.**
As the use of heuristics depends on the cues we subconsciously read from the situation, ourÂ **decision-making depends greatly on the environment and the context in which it is made.**

**consider the surroundings your customers will see the product in and the options they will compare it to.**

In case you donâ€™t know, thatâ€™s exactly why Rolls-Royce and Maserati donâ€™t sell their cars at car shows. They know the cars look expensive there. What they do instead is sell them at yacht and plane shows, where, among their bigger and pricier brothers, cars are more of an impulse buy.

## Deep dive

Context can impact customer decisions in marketing and LPG in various ways, including cultural, psychological, economic, and social aspects. Here are some examples of how these different contexts can influence customer decisions:

### Cultural Context
- **Family-Oriented Purchasing**: In some cultures, consumers are more likely to make purchases based on how much they benefit the wider family, which can influence their decision-making process and the marketing strategies that resonate with them[1].
- **Cultural Values and Preferences**: Cultural influences play a significant role in shaping customer preferences, such as prioritizing affordability and discounts in some cultures, while others prioritize quality and craftsmanship[5].

### Psychological Context
- **Marketing Psychology**: Marketing psychology anticipates buyer behavior by understanding cognitive biases and applies theoretical knowledge to the marketing field to drive purchase behavior[4].
- **Emotional Impact**: The impact of emotions on customer decision making is a key factor in acquisition, influencing the way customers perceive and choose products and services[8].

### Economic Context
- **Consumer Decision Making Process Theory**: This theory guides businesses in understanding their potential customers and developing strategies to encourage purchase decisions in their favor, based on several economic factors[7].
- **Key Factors Affecting Decision Making**: Consumer behavior is influenced by personal, psychological, social, and situational factors, all of which affect consumer decision-making in the economic context[10].

### Social Context
- **Social Influences on Consumer Behavior**: Social influences, such as online recommendations, family and friends' recommendations, and social media, can significantly impact consumer decision making[10].
- **Consumer Decision Journey**: Understanding how consumers make decisions and focusing on the most influential touch points is crucial in the social context of consumer decision making[11].

These examples illustrate how various contexts, including cultural, psychological, economic, and social factors, can significantly influence customer decisions in marketing and LPG.
