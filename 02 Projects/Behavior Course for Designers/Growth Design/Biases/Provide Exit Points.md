Allow users to disengage from your product with a sense of **completion**.

In the context of addicting products, it's the ethical thing to do (as you'll see in Mod. 4). And in the context of transactional products like here, it's a way to keep users sane.

If not, people will associate your product to a **never-ending treadmill**—which may hurt your long-term user retention.
