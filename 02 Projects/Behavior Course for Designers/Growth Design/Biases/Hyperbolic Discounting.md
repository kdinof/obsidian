Hyperbolic discounting is a cognitive bias deeply rooted in human behavior, causing individuals to **value immediate rewards more than long-term larger rewards**[1]. This phenomenon occurs due to the difficulty in evaluating the future and the perceived risk associated with long-term rewards compared to immediate ones[1]. In the context of product development, hyperbolic discounting can be leveraged to improve marketing strategies and increase conversion rates. Some ways to utilize hyperbolic discounting in marketing include:

1. **Highlighting immediate benefits**: Emphasizing the benefits of a product or service that can be enjoyed immediately can tap into the desire for instant gratification[2].

2. **Limited-time offers**: Creating a sense of urgency by offering time-sensitive promotions can encourage customers to act promptly[2].

3. **Loyalty programs**: Implementing loyalty programs that provide immediate rewards for continued engagement can help capture consumer interest[2].

4. **Free offers**: Offering free samples or trials can help customers experience the benefits of a product or service firsthand, increasing the likelihood of conversion[4].

5. **Delayed payment**: Allowing customers to postpone payment for goods or services can make the items' price less relevant, as the immediate reward of receiving the product dominates the buyer's decision-making process[4].

6. **Point system**: Creating a point system that rewards customers for their purchases can encourage immediate purchases and build long-term loyalty[3].

By understanding and utilizing hyperbolic discounting in marketing, businesses can develop effective strategies that resonate with their audience's desire for instant gratification, leading to increased conversion rates and customer engagement[2]. However, it is essential to use these tactics responsibly and not exploit the hyperbolic discounting principle in ways that may harm consumers or the economy as a whole[4].
