That's great! As a product design lead, you're already in the thick of things. Let's build on that.

Product design primarily focuses on the creation and continuous improvement of products by understanding user needs, creating solutions, and iteratively testing and refining those solutions. It's holistic, considering the entire user journey and how each component of the product fits into the user's life, aiming for a cohesive, intuitive, and enjoyable experience.

Growth design, on the other hand, while it encompasses aspects of product design, is more data-driven and experiment-oriented, specifically aimed at improving metrics that are directly related to business growthâ€”like user acquisition, retention, and monetization. Growth designers hypothesize, implement, and measure the impact of design changes, often through A/B testing, to quickly determine what works and what doesn't in terms of driving user growth and engagement.

Imagine you're a chef (product designer) in a restaurant. You're focused on creating a delightful meal (product) that satisfies customers' hunger (user needs) and provides a delightful experience. Now, think of a growth designer as a chef who specifically focuses on dishes that not only satisfy hunger but also ensure that customers come back more often and bring their friends (growth metrics).

For example, a product designer might redesign a checkout process to make it more intuitive and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience. A growth designer, however, might focus on optimizing the same checkout process but with the specific goal of increasing conversion rates, like adding a progress bar or simplifying form fields to reduce abandonment.

Another example might be in a social media app. A product designer would focus on the usability and aesthetics of a new feature, ensuring it fits seamlessly into the overall app. A growth designer would look at that feature and run experiments to see how it could be tweaked to increase user engagement or attract new users.
