## How To Use Emotional Design to Keep Customers Happy 

When you arrive at a Disney Resort Hotel, staff greet you at the door, holding it open and cheerfully engaging with visitors as they enter.

The moment you reach the inside of one of the theme parks, there is upbeat, happy music, shops with colourful designs and the view of the Disney Castle in the distance. There is even a bakery at Disney Florida, where the lovely smell of freshly baked cookies hits you as soon as you enter the park. None of this is by accident.

In fact, this engineering process has a name. [**Emotional Design**](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/emotional-design). 

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">First coined by author and Professor [Donald A. Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman), Emotional Design is the **process of using design to create emotions which result in positive customer experiences**. Or to quote Professor Norman, “attractive things work better, or they certainly make one’s perceptions more forgiving”. </mark>

> Disney knows that unhappiness spreads like wildfire and can quickly infect an entire group and even bystanders.

Well, Disney are masters of emotional design. Disney hits guests right away with emotional design elements that make customers happy from the moment they set foot in the parks . (If you have never been to a Disney theme park, it is difficult to explain just how magical entering a park feels.  It genuinely feels like you have been transported to a different world).

However, you could argue that it is the human interactions within Disney that really make the experience an incredible one. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Disney trains employees to look for upset guests and interact with them to keep them happy. They know that [unhappiness spreads](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200085847_The_Psychology_of_waiting_lines) like wildfire and can quickly infect an entire group and even bystanders.</mark>

So, when a Disney cast member (they refer to their staff as cast members) greets you in their parks with a smile and some cheerful conversation, it can quickly change a situation from one of doom and gloom to one of smiles and happiness.

This pivotal moment works on several levels.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Firstly, we have the **rule of reciprocation**, made famous by [Professor Robert B. Cialdini](https://www.influenceatwork.com/) in his classic book, ‘Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion’. 

The rule states that we should try and pay in kind what another person has provided us on a behavioural level. So, when someone is cheerful with us, we tend to be pleasant to them too.</mark>

But that’s not where the genius of this Disney customer interaction ends. Because not only do they prime guests to be in a good mood, they also eliminate confusion.

The cast member can answer questions, give advice and even offer help and directions. 

This action eliminates stress from the guest because <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">**unhappiness stems from fear of the unknown and uncertainty**.</mark>

On the surface, this simple Disney interaction would seem an unnecessary expense. But Disney understands a day at a theme park can be a tiring experience for guests both young and old. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">By having staff engage in emotional work such as this, they prime their guests to remain happy even as they spend hours standing in line for theme park rides. </mark>

However, the behavioural science doesn’t end there. Next, we will look at how design plays a massive part in the Disney queue experience.

## How To Make Lining Up For Hours Seem Far Less Longer

Before we learn how Disney has revolutionized their theme park queueing systems, we need to dive deep into the science of time and distance.

==When it comes to time and distance, there are 2 essential aspects to understand. First, physicists measure physical aspects of time and distance. But secondly, **how we perceive them as individuals is a** [**psychological process that is based on context**.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936574/)==

Think about it. Have you ever reached a destination and thought, “that didn’t take as long as I expected”. Or has a 9-hour flight seemed to take half that time because you watched several great films onboard?

Disney knows how our brains process time. And they have gone to great effort to ensure that they make standing in line feel far less long than it actually is. But how do they do this?

### How Disney Use In-line Entertainment To ‘Speed Up Time’

> That's because Disney knows that mental activity dramatically affects the psychological experience of the duration of time.

When you line up for a ride at Disney, you soon find out that it isn’t like any other type of line.

From animatronic displays to fountains and cast members in costume. There is always something to see and do.

==That’s because Disney knows that **mental activity dramatically affects the psychological experience** of the duration of [time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685813/). So Disney is always trying to give us something to see, do and talk about to others.==

[![A Disney application that lets you discover the whole park](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disney_1-1024x492.jpg.webp)](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disney_1.jpg)

And Disney hasn’t stopped with physical interaction points. They have also developed a **Disney App** that provides guests with interactive games, trivia and music. Guests are encouraged to use this app while in line in the park. By giving guests things to do, their brains become occupied and the experience of lining up changes dramatically.

### How To Use Curves to Change the Perception of Distance

When at Disney, you will quickly see that the **theme park lines are never straight**.

While that might be owing to some space-saving elements, it certainly helps with the mood of customers.

==No one wants to see a line stretching as far as the eye can see. So **Disney uses twists and turns to reduce the visual distance of the line you can see**. This trick works because most people never try and look past what is known as [‘the limit point’](https://www.iamroadsmart.com/docs/librariesprovider41/observer-documents/driver-observer-handbook.pdf?sfvrsn=1feb59_4).==

Limit Point Analysis is a method used by advanced drivers to see if they need to slow down at a bend. To do this, an advanced driver will look for clues such as the lines on the road, road posts and other aspects to decide if they need to reduce speed or not.

In theme park lines, customers either can’t look beyond the limit point or are distracted, so they don’t try. Either way, the result is a happier guest.

### How Double Buffering Can Utilize The Ikea Effect

The term ‘double buffering’ hails from computing and allows one page aspect to load first and then be followed by a second aspect. The result is less frustration at a slow loading page or programme.

Disney uses this approach to make lining up even more interactive and to make it appear faster.

When you reach towards the end of a line, rather than keep you standing around, Disney makes you become part of the ride. They do this using ‘staging areas’.

These staging areas are where cast members or even videos are used to set the scene of the attraction. This area is where you might be asked to split your group into teams to battle each other or decide on roles.

Not only does that engage you mentally, but it also makes you become part of a ‘mission’. This process triggers another concept of behavioral economics known as the Ikea Effect. The name stems from a 2011 [study](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/11-091.pdf) that found that subjects were willing to pay 63% more for furniture they had assembled themselves.

Ikea effect

When you put effort into something, it becomes more valuable to you than its objective value

When Disney uses staging areas for rides, guests enjoy the experience by becoming part of the attraction. And as we know, every narrative used on Disney theme park attractions leaves the rider with a successful ending.

The study into the Ikea effect showed that labour leads to increased value when the task is successful. So, when Disney gives their guests work to do on a ride, such as the Toy Story ride, where guests have to fire guns as part of their mission,  **the Ikea Effect suggests that the guests will value the successful ending even more**.

I can only speak from experience, that the rides where Disney gave my family tasks to undertake were not only more enjoyable than others, but they energised our family. The key takeaway is that once in the staging area, we forgot we were even waiting in a line. We became fully immersed in the experience.

## Why Making Memories Should Be A Business Priority

When children go to Disney, one of the most essential park experiences is meeting the characters. As an adult, you know the reality. You are standing in line to meet a Disney cast member, probably baking hot inside a character outfit. (And that’s before even contemplating the bizarre Disney logic of how Mickey is now 6 ft tall and can only communicate by waves of his hand).

But you don’t care. Each day thousands of adults line up with their children to have photos taken with characters and also to meet them.

But Disney realized something that took behavioral scientists a while to catch onto. Those photographs change our memories. Bob Sutton, a professor at Stanford University, has proposed in his [studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/105649269214002), that photographs enhance the positive memory of an event.

And at Disney, there are photographers all over the park taking photos of you and your family. These are then uploaded to a portal to view and decide which you want to keep. There are many ‘photo’ locations in the lines of Disney rides and attractions that will remind people of what a great day they had long after they have left.

### How Managing Expectations of Queue Times is a Customer Experience Game Changer

> Providing estimated queue times on their rides helps to manage guest expectations. However, make sure you only show the upper limit of the wait time, so you don't disappoint customers.

As stated previously, customers dislike the fear of the unknown. And for that reason, Disney has utilized 2 other key elements in reducing customer [frustration](https://d.lib.msu.edu/islandora/object/etd:4047/datastream/OBJ/download/THE_PERCEPTION_OF_TIME_WAITING_IN_THEME_PARK_QUEUE_LINES.pdf).

Firstly, **they provide estimated queue times on their rides**. This helps to manage guest expectations. However, make sure you only show the upper limit of the wait time. So you don’t disappoint customers. 

Secondly, they use a filter system for the rides. If you have ever seen this in operation, you know exactly what I am talking about. Most rides have 4 to 6 seating locations within each ‘carriage’. Staff will ask people to stand in rows adjacent to each seating location.

You might be wondering why this matters. Well, it is all to do with the **perception of the speed of the** [**line**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200085847_The_Psychology_of_waiting_lines). This filter system speeds the foot movement of the line and maximizes guest space to give the **experience that the line is moving faster**.

### How To Use Targeted Admission Times (To Enhance Business Reputation)

No matter how good a business is at managing its in-line experience. People are still standing in a line. Yet, Disney even managed to turn this on its head. They created something called a ‘Fast Pass’. This service allows guests to book a time when they go on a ride or attraction without lining up. Or certainly without lining up as long as they normally would.

The benefits to customers and theme parks are apparent. Shorter lines, happier guests, and again, removal of the fear of the unknown, as guests can plan out their day and time effectively.

However, the key to ensuring that a scheme like this is a success boils down to [fairness.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40470906?seq=1) 

At Disney, every customer can access the FastPass system via an app or various terminals located inside the parks. However, at neighboring theme parks ‘Universal Studios’ their scheme operates on a financial basis.

To get on rides faster, you must pay more money for a ticket upgrade. This system creates an internal park ‘financial’ hierarchy that has received some criticism online.

> Our brains look for shortcuts to see if something is worth the money or not. In the case of Disney, if guests stay for longer and there are more attractions, mentally guests will assign greater value to the price of the tickets.

## How Disney Makes Thousands of People Want To Line Up Every Day

There is no doubt about it. Adding rides to a theme park is an expensive thing to do. But Disney has not only found a way to utilize the vast amounts of space at their parks to engage large numbers of guests. They have also been able to add greater perceived value to park tickets and encourage visitors to stay right up until the parks shut.

This is key because **we don’t know the exact value of experiences**, so our brains look for shortcuts to see if something is worth the money or not. In the case of Disney, if guests stay for longer and there are more attractions, mentally guests will assign greater value to the price of the tickets.

So, how does Disney get people to stay in their parks right up until closing time? By putting on parades and firework shows. Both the daytime and nighttime parades act as reasons to stay longer in parks and offer different experiences.

> Our perceptions of an experience are greatly determined by the peak experiences. These are the most emotionally intense experiences and the experience at the end.

The guests will line up willingly on the theme park’s streets to await the parades, and this will undoubtedly cause lines at rides to reduce dramatically.

But this is only part of the experience. The grand finale is the incredible light and fireworks shows at all of the Disney parks. This ending is genuinely breathtaking and a magical way to end the day. But that’s not all that is going on. Here **Disney leverages what is called** [**The Peak End Rule**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5246508_Evaluations_of_Pleasurable_Experiences_The_Peak-End_Rule)**.**

In behavioral economics, we have learned that our perceptions of an experience are greatly determined by peak experiences. **These are the most emotionally intense experiences and the experience at the end**.

With an ending like this, people tend to forget how long they stood in line, in the baking hot Floridian sun. They forget the tropical storm that drenched them at 3 pm and the 5000 calories they consumed in fast food. And they forget the 5 arguments they had with their family on things like ‘picking the wrong car parking space’ and ‘getting us lost’.

No, they walk away, having had a truly magical experience after watching a firework spectacle.

#### Key Takeaways:

- **Train staff to look for confused or unhappy customers** and engage them in positive dialogue to improve their mood and reduce confusion.
- **Occupy your customers while they wait.** Unoccupied wait feels much longer. Consider in-line activities. This might be a quiz on a tablet, some games to occupy children, or educational material.
- **Tell customers how long they will wait.** Inform customers of the anticipated wait time before they line up. Be conservative in the time estimate. You want customers to wait shorter than they expect
- **Focus your efforts on ending each customer experience with style.** We evaluate experiences based on the most intense moment and the ending.
