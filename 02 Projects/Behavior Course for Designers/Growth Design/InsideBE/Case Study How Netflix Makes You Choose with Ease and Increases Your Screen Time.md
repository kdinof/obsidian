#### In this case study, you’ll discover:

- Why time is the No.1 Enemy when it comes to satisfaction;
- What tricks Netflix uses to make choosing easy and remorse-free; and
- How to categorize your selection to tap into different psychological drives that make choosing easier.

## Plenty of options, but hard choices

**When there’s too much to choose from it can be debilitating**. Unsure what to watch, you find yourself endlessly scrolling through the Netflix library to the point of getting stressed about all the time it’s taking. You wind up watching Ghostbusters for the 14th time and fall asleep midway through.

But it’s not just you – anyone would feel overwhelmed when they’re faced with 50 000+ titles to choose from! And that could threaten Netflix’s primary goal which is to increase “hours per subscriber per month”.

So how does the company – which claims that its **real competition is time, not other streaming platforms** – tackle choice overload, the nemesis of sales and customer satisfaction? 

And how can you use that same psychology, to make choosing easier and faster, even if you operate on a smaller scale?

---

## Managing choice with ease

==Going back to choosing what to watch, perhaps you’ve noticed that when you finally  pick something after a long deliberation, you’re less satisfied with it than you would be if you had decided to watch the very same thing in a split second. You’re still questioning whether the other options might have been better. The same thing happens when we’re shopping. This is called buyer’s remorse.==

> ==The more challenging the decision, the more important it seems. The more time the customer spends on it, the less likely they are to be satisfied with it.==

==A growing amount of [research](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/R1205G-PDF-ENG) shows that **if deciding takes too long it starts to feel more important**, and even consequential (yes, even if it’s just a show). No one wants to feel like they’re failing at something so trivial.== 

In other words, the more challenging the decision, the more important it seems. The more time the customer spends on it, the less likely they are to be satisfied with it.

There are a couple of different ways to solve this inner conflict caused by choice overload (neither of which is a winner for Netflix):

- **We can choose to watch something we know and like** (bad for discovering some of Netflix’s unique content & prized original shows and movies),
- **We may choose to watch something new** but then not be as satisfied with it as we would have been if we had decided quickly,
- **We may choose to bail out –** turn it off and move on to sex, sleep, or Salt ‘n’ Shake.

Choice overload

Choice overload is a result of too many choices being available. It can result in decision fatigue, sticking to the default option or even avoiding making a decision altogether.

==The tendency to bail out is a major [hurdle in retail](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2008/12/18/the-way-the-brain-buys) too. Scott Bearse, a retail expert who has reviewed the buying habits of tens of thousands customers, points out that it’s not the price that causes people to leave shops empty-handed, but the fact that they are “unable to decide”.==

So what are the ways Netflix employs to make choosing quick and guilt-free?

### Categorization & submenu headlines that sell

The streaming giant doesn’t list all its titles from A to Z. It knows that choosing from a list of thousands is complicated, but **picking** **from a few movies within a certain category can be less daunting**. 

==Reducing the amount of information we have to process helps us to make faster decisions. So chunking down a seemingly infinite number of titles into a meaningful, comprehensive and finite(!) number of categories is a good strategy.==

> A study found that consumers like unfamiliar products to be categorised. It didn’t matter whether they were marked simply A, B and C, or had more meaningful tags.

==But more interestingly, choosing from a categorized assortment, as opposed to an uncategorized one, makes us more satisfied with what we pick!==

==A [study](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8K360W8) conducted by researchers from Stanford University found that consumers like unfamiliar products to be categorised – even if the categories are meaningless!== People were happier with their choice of coffee if it came from a categorised selection. It didn’t matter whether they were marked simply A, B and C, or had more meaningful tags such as “mild”, “dark roast” and “nutty.”


Netflix categorizes its titles in various ways – each tapping into different psychological drives, all designed to steer us toward a decision which is so quick that it almost feels like a no-brainer.

So what is the perfect recipe to put together category lists like that, and how should you name them?

### Social proof & the fear of missing out

The titles Netflix would like you to watch most are its _originals_. But watching something new feels like buying a pig in a poke. Besides, who’s got 20 minutes or more to go through all the previews of the newly added items, right? 

==**When choice overload meets uncertainty, it’s a double whammy**! But the good news is that when we’re uncertain, we look at what others do; that’s why social proof is often used as a reassurance in sales and marketing.== It’s especially important if a customer is entering uncharted territory.

Social proof

Social proof is our tendency to be influenced by what others do, how they think and behave. Especially when we are uncertain what to do.

When observing customers going about their daily shopping, [researchers](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2008/12/18/the-way-the-brain-buys) found that 12% of them spent about a minute and a half studying the label of juices, but then did not select any. Even though customers were interested in opting for a more wholesome alternative to fizzy drinks, they were discouraged because choosing was just too hard! 

Here, a simple reassurance – such as “our most frequently picked juice” or “this week’s most popular choice” – attached to a specific can help alleviate doubt.

==But on Netflix’s home page, social proof does more than reassure. It also **induces risk of loss** by creating FOMO.== 

Few things feel more isolating than not being let in on a secret or joke, and there’s a good evolutionary reason for that. 

==Back in the day, not having crucial information could cost you your life. Being out of the loop about who Simon Basset is may not lead to such a dire consequence, but our brains still perceive it as a risk of a similar magnitude.== 

Loss aversion

We are roughly 2.5 times more sensitive to losses than we are to gains of similar size

We suspect our colleagues will be discussing popular shows during their water-cooler chats, so we feel we should watch at least one episode to know what’s what.

And conveniently enough, we can choose from not just one, but two submenus Netflix have built around this concern:

- ==**Trending now –** a slightly ambiguous title titillates our curiosity. 
- ==**Top 10 in your country** – a more salient display signifies that this is something worth paying attention to.==

### Personalization

==**Another way** to name a submenu and make choosing easier **is to mitigate** **risk** – offering reassurance that you will make a winning move based on your viewing history:==

- **% matching** – do you feel that jolt of excitement when you spot a 98% match? Likewise, doesn’t it feel easy to pass on something that’s only 56%? You’re not alone. Research shows that the more personalized content a user sees, the better their [engagement](https://info.monetate.com/rs/092-TQN-434/images/EQ4%202018%20-%20Progressing%20With%20Personalization.pdf?source=post_page). 
- **“Because you watched XX**” – an elegant way to keep you in the same genre without having to search for other titles via menu options. This saves you about 4 clicks which is immense!

### “Pre-selected” options

For the worst situations when customers _can’t choose_ it may help to use wording that implies something is a default option. 

Netflix defaults us in 3 different ways:

Salience

==Everything that stands out, is novel, or seems relevant, captures people’s attention, and makes it more likely to affect their thinking and actions.==

- **“Continue watching” –** a salient display of in-progress items exploits the fact we are bothered by unfinished business. In fact, a growing amount of [research](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/37/5/888/1870004?login=true) shows that the closer we are to finishing a task, the more motivated we are to do so. If you can give customers a feeling of a jump-start they might be more inclined to [finish](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10864415.2016.1204195?casa_token=zUuq-S1ZNOgAAAAA%3AYQPsf4UMXlR-ZMv6XJL4UIXxcsWEp6UTC4A_OGzNbgOY6koQiCq3bGsZnRsRjgm9ASIxvkzBRuQGsAg&journalCode=mjec20) the process.
- **“Watch it again”** – when overwhelmed, we tend to stick to what we know, so why not make it easier by serving it on a silver platter … er … submenu. If something feels like a safe harbor we can commit to it without risk. What’s familiar, feels more [trustworthy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048300000219?casa_token=Su9-4mXJ76oAAAAA:4mqDHR2Thz5czQss6psR-elYm9v3SXoxmzqygRq8GvX0i1UWWV-yXG8OjUGGPStOuo0vQYhbSDc%20Zobrazit%20m%C3%A9n%C4%9B). 
- **“You finished watching XX, what’s playing next?”** – Netflix doesn’t risk you getting lost again and jumps in to aid your next steps with a timely notification in the top right corner of your dashboard.


### The Ultimate Default: Shuffle play

Imagine you wander into a new coffee shop that offers many types of blends and you don’t know which one to pick. ==Thankfully, there’s a blend of the day that catches your eye. “Alright, that sounds about right,” you exclaim, and happily forget about the vast array of other options==. The choice you’ve just made – which was technically made for you – feels easy. 

==In the spring of 2021, after a steady drop in numbers following an unprecedented surge during the pandemic, Netflix offered its version of the ‘blend of the day’ menu – **a** **feature called “play something”**.==

This “shuffle” option is a form of default – click it and you will instantly be taken to a show or a movie that the Netflix algorithm has determined will suit your tastes. No “watcher’s remorse”, no time lost endlessly scrolling through submenus hoping to find something that miraculously meets all your needs.

The company even uses [timing](https://www.bi.team/publications/east-four-simple-ways-to-apply-behavioural-insights/) in an interesting way. The “play something” option is not displayed randomly, but pops up at three specific places:

1. **Located under your name** – before you even have a chance to get swamped by the sheer number of options.

[![Netflix welcome screen](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/netflix2-2-1024x492.jpg.webp)](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/netflix2-2.jpg)

Netflix takes you straight to watching, with a single click on the welcome page.

2. ==**As a row on the homepage** – after people have scrolled through lots of submenus and Netflix suspects they are getting frustrated, the Play Something option pops up.==

[![Netflix provides a solution when you are not sure what to watch](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/netflix2-3-1024x492.jpg.webp)](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/netflix2-3.jpg)

After scrolling all the way down, Netflix addresses the specific concern “not sure what to watch?” and provides a solution.

3. ==**In the user menu** – a one-click shortcut to new series or films similar to ones you’ve watched before, or the next episode from a show you’ve started but haven’t finished.==

[![A convenient one-click option right in the side menu.](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/netflix2-4-1024x492.jpg.webp)](https://insidebe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/netflix2-4.jpg)

==The problem is that the stakes of getting it right or wrong are higher than on Apple Music or Spotify. A song is less of a commitment than a show or a movie.== Skipping through a bunch of songs that don’t quite fit your taste isn’t going to make you write the whole thing off, but when it comes to ill-fitting streaming recommendations, you may be less forgiving.

Besides, all of us have songs we just can’t get enough of and listen to on a loop. But if you “get played” a series you have watched on a different platform, you may be less eager to watch it again. No Netflix! Next!

As Guardian writer [Stuart Heritage](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stuart-heritage) concluded after [trying](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/04/netflix-play-something-feature) this feature, “It seems to be the streaming equivalent of buying someone a book for their birthday.” The chances of getting it right are not that great. Stuart goes on to add: “It’s a nice try, but it’s basically channel hopping. Wasn’t Netflix supposed to end all that?”

To that we say: yes! So it’s good that Netflix has got **more tricks up its sleeve** to eliminate the tyranny of too many options: from categorization, social proof, and personalization to pre-selected options, you’re free to choose which one will work best for your business’s bottom line. 

And since we only gave you four major categories, hopefully, choice overload has not kicked in. If you want to read about the psychology behind Netflix’s registration process, click [here](https://insidebe.com/articles/how-netflix-uses-psychology/).

#### Key takeaways:
- **Make choosing easier by creating meaningful category groups** to avoid choice overload. 
- **Name your category options in more meaningful ways –** ways that are closer to how a customer operates and that drive relevance (not just “dramas”, but “because you watched Twelve Angry Men”).
- **Use peer pressure to either leverage social proof or FOMO**. Make your promo message claims universal – so that they speak to not just one, but both types of customers: those who need the reassurance social proof offers and those who worry they might be left out. 
- **When everything else fails give people a safe option**. Default them to something they are familiar with, so they can commit to it without risk.[]()
