# Lesson Summary
---

1. Stories are crucial forÂ **customer empathy**.
2. Customer empathy helps you buildÂ **better experiences**.
3. You can createÂ **minimum viable stories**Â by usingÂ [[6P Stories]].

Stories are often better than screens toÂ **understand what your users really need**Â and the context of interaction with your product. Thatâ€™s because:

- Screens merely tell youÂ _what_Â happens. Only journeys can tell youÂ **why and how**.Â 
- Screens make you focus on your product. Not the problem. Itâ€™s dangerously easy to become attached to existing solutions youâ€™ve put a lot of effort into ([ðŸ§  Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://growth.design/psychology/#sunk-cost) [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Sunk Cost Fallacy]]). On the other hand, storiesÂ **focus on the customer first**.

- [[Character Identification Effect]] Stories make your brain imagine thatÂ **you**Â are going through the journey. In other words, you develop a higher-level ofÂ **empathy**Â for the hero of a story. Neuroscientists have shown thatÂ **stories**are theÂ **single best**Â vehicle we have to transfer our ideas to one another. It'sÂ **no coincidence**Â that we use stories in our case studiesâ€¦ and in this course.

Comics forceÂ **constant participation**and imagination. That sparks creativity and help you find solutions.

And stories are up to 22 times easier to remember than stand-alone fact, this makes this 6P story short enough to remember, while leaving enough gaps to imagine opportunities to improve.[_Wikipedia_, Miller's Law (2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%27s_law) [_Stanford University GSB_, Jennifer Aaker (2020)](https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/stories)

The equivalent of their "**6P Stories**" (one for each of their 3 personas) are displayed in a few places in their offices. They even hired a Pixar artist for the final version of their customer journeys.
