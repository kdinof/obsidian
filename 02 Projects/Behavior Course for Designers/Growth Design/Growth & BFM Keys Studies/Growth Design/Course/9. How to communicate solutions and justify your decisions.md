# Lesson Summary
---
To make sure you succeed in presenting new ideas, you first need to **understand business goals**. One way to do so is to understand what stakeholders want with these key questions (same questions you used in Module 1 to understand users’ motivations):

- 💛 What’s their vision for the future of the business?
- ☔️ What’s the biggest challenge they face right now?
- 🚧 What’s currently stopping them from reaching that vision?

This doesn’t have to be a formal interview (just grab a coffee with them!) Also, if you notice “a gap” in what you say and what they interpret, you can **apply the B.I.A.S. framework** to reverse-engineer your communications and find better ways to express yourself!

Finally, here are 4 other tactics that will help you communicate your decisions clearly:

1. **Lead with a story:** As seen in module 1, stories rally people around the user, not individual opinions. It can also generate a lot of new ideas.
2. **Use the right vocabulary:** Having the right words to describe your thoughts is a major asset. It’s hard to argue when you have scientific psychological principles to back up your decisions.
3. **Create guardrails for your feedback:** Don’t show designs without specifically asking what you want feedback on. It’s the best way to focus the conversation and make team decisions quickly.
4. **Know how to answer feedback:** Avoid reacting negatively to criticism.. It just looks bad. Instead, follow this quick guide 👇.

> - **🌱 Lead with a yes:** The first thing you should always do is acknowledge the feedback. Thank the person who took the time to care about your work.
> - **💫 Repeat and Empathize:** Briefly summarize what they just said. Re-phrase their response in the form of a question that forces them to elaborate on their point of view. Ask questions about what feelings are driving their statements. (What are they afraid of? What concerns do they have with what’s presented?)
> - **🙏 Assure:** Assure them that you care about finding the best solution before responding.
