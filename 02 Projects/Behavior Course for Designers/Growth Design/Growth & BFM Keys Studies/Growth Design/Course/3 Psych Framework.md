# Lesson Summary
---

**Psych** is like a precious cognitive resource:
1. `Psych = M·A` : it’s like merging the **Motivation** and **Ability** axes of the Behavior Map.
2. **Every user interaction** will either add or subtract Psych ([Net Perceived Value](https://members.growth.design/lessons/ppm-psych/#net-perceived-value)).
3. **Motivating users** is just as important as reducing unnecessary friction.

Think of your customer as the hero of a video game, and their _Psych Level_ as their health:

- 🏔 Your job is to help them **achieve _their_ quest** (not just your business goals).
- 💙 To keep their Psych up, you need to **motivate them** and **minimize friction**.
- ☠ If their _Psych Level_ drops too much, it’s **game over** for them (…and for you!)

**Friction = less ability**. This means that customers have to use more Psych to take action.

But **friction isn’t always bad**. In fact, it can have a net positive impact on the user’s Psych Level if that “good friction” aligns with the user’s motivations.

That’s why carefully adding valuable steps in a user experience can sometimes increase the overall conversion rate (despite the slight extra time/effort required).

- Psych'd Framework Several years ago, I used to call this video game analogy applied to user experience "**Action Points**". When I later heard Darius Contractor talking about "Psych Points" during a Openview Podcast, I found it so close that I thought it'd be simpler to use his terminology to amplify the message. So I just wanted to give our friend Darius a grateful hat tip for that clever term! [_Build Podcast_, How Dropbox Reached 1B$](https://overcast.fm/+MMlwNSM7M/11:50)
