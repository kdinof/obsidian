The best strategies to **reduce friction** are:
1. **🗑 Removing options:** The more choices, the longer it takes to decide [[Hick’s Law]].
2. **🚦 Valid Defaults:** Create experiences that don’t absolutely need user input.
3. **✂ Split steps:** It’s easier to do three small steps than a big one [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Cognitive Load]]
4. **🌱 Reveal features gradually:** Even if you’re excited to show what your product can do, make sure people have time to understand each component [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Progressive Disclosure]]

The most common way to **nudge** effectively:
1. **👥 Social Proof:** Showing what others did in the same situation is reassuring for users.
2. **💭 [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Curiosity Gap]]:** The gap caused by curiosity is painful and people need to fill that gap.
3. **🦄 Scarcity:** When things are limited, people tend to want more of it.

As seen previously, this gives a lot of power to defaults since **only a handful of people** **change them.**(~5%) [_Dre Zhou_, How to add product features without making it more complex (2018)](https://uxdesign.cc/default-valid-vs-default-invalid-641570ae2fec)   [_UX Planet_, The Power of Defaults (2017)](https://uxplanet.org/the-power-of-defaults-992d50b73968)
- [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Commitment & Consistency]]Getting users to make a small commitment and follow up on it **can increase engagement.** The smaller the initial ask, the more likely people will agree to do bigger tasks. Especially since **the brain likes to be consistent** with its previous actions. It’s why multi-step forms can be **271% better** than a big single-step form.

- [[Decrease Your DPP]] When evaluating if a screen is "easy" or "hard" to deal with, try **counting the number of decisions per page** someone has to make to move forward. Include actions (which always require a decision) and information that leads to a decision. (headlines, subtexts, CTAs, fields, etc.)/ If the number is **higher than ~7±2**([[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Miller's law]]), you should consider applying some of the principles in this lesson (like splitting steps!)

  **🔥 Pro Tip:** Show only the core features of your product, and as users get familiar, unveil new options. It **keeps the interface simple** for new users and **progressively brings power**to advanced users.

- Nudge: [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Curiosity Gap]] Gaps cause pain. When we want to know something but can’t, **it’s like having an itch that we need to scratch.** To take away the pain, we need to **fill the knowledge gap.** [_Chip & Dan Heath_, Made to stick (2007)](https://medium.com/@aidanhornsby/notes-on-made-to-stick-b23250f564ec)

	1. ⌛️ Time-limited  
	2. 🧮 Quantity-limited  
	3. 🔑 Access-limited
