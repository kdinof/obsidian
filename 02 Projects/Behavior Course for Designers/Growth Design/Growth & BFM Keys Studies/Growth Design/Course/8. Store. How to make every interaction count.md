# Lesson Summary
---
That stored information drives the way we **Block → Interpret → Act** (going through the BIAS loop) for the subsequent interactions. For example, if you just stored negative psych after a less than average experience, you’re more likely to block more information, lowering your chance to move forward successfully.

With that in mind, 4 key things can help people store positive psych (in order of impact):
1. **👀 Clear feedback:** Each interaction should clearly show what just happened.
2. **👊 Reassurance:** Confirm they’re doing the right thing. You want them to feel “in good hands.”
3. **💙 Feeling of caring:** Showing you have people’s best interests at heart.
4. **🍭 Delighters:** Going above and beyond can leave a positive mark in the mind of people.

In general, incorporating **human empathy** into your products will always be a positive long-term investment.
