## Lesson Summary

Let’s recap the things we block and the things that capture our attention.

We automatically block anything that’s:
1. **🧮 High-Effort:** We’re biologically wired to save energy, so we usually take the path of least resistance. Also, a large number of choices can trigger action paralysis (Hick’s law).
   Пример сложного продукта, где не понятно с чего начинать и Duolingo
2. **🌵 Unrelated:** Anything that’s not related to what we want is filtered out (Selective attention).
3. **👯‍♀️ Redundant (избыточный):** Once we detect a pattern that isn’t aligned with our interests, we filter it out (Banner blindness).

Our attention is captured by things that are:
1. **🐟 In our short-term memory:** We can easily recall information that we’ve just seen (Priming). Например баннеры перед заказом в макдональдсе
2. **💚 Confirming our beliefs:** We’re attracted to similarity or like-minded thoughts (Confirmation Bias).
3. **🎲 Unexpected:** When something is new (Pattern Breaks), funny, or customized to our likings (Personalization), we usually pay attention.

- Edge Blindness People have gotten used to the idea that there are **things on screens that are less relevant** to the task at hand, such as: logos, navigation bars, footers, and blank space. They tend to look at the center of the screen and **avoid the edges.** Make sure critical information is not displayed as such. [_Susan M.

- Short Vs. Long-Term Thinking Research has shown that companies **focused on the long term averaged 47% more revenues** than short-term focus companies. Optimizing for short-term goals will find its way to the product and **eventually affect users**, compromising your user experience and long-term growth.

- [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Priming]] Priming works by **activating an association or representation** in users' short-term memory just before another task is introduced. This technique generated a **lift of ~3-5% in sales for McDonald's** by priming different menu items depending on the time of day and weather!

- [[Baader-Meinhof Effect]] This phenomenon happens **when your awareness of something increases.** You're then likely to see or hear that thing more often, even if it's not the case. It's perfectly normal. Your brain is simply **reinforcing the newly acquired information.** [_Ann Pietrangelo_ , What the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon Is (2019)](https://www.healthline.com/health/baader-meinhof-phenomenon) Например при новости о крушении самолета сразу повышается страх полетов.
- Personalization People tend to be more receptive when **experiences are customized to their needs,** a sign of careful attention. This feeling originates from a mix of the endowment effect,1 loss aversion, and reciprocity, where we feel something has more value if it **belongs to us.** [_Growth.Design_, Psychology of Design (2020)](https://growth.design/psychology)
