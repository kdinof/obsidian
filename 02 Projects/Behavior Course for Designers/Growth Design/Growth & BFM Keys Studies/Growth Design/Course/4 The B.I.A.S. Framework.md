# Lesson Summary
---
In this lesson, we saw that the brain thinks in two different ways:

- **System 1** is automatic, driven by instinct (or recognition) and prior learning.
- **System 2** is slower, driven by deliberation and logic.

Why is this important?
Because **most of our decisions are driven by system 1**, and as product experts, we need to master the art of designing for “fast processes” (system 1).

That’s why we created the 🌀 B.I.A.S. Framework to help you **understand the psychological principles** behind System 1 thinking.

**Block → Interpret → Act → Store**
