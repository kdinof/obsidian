1. **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Familiarity]]:** Reusing existing patterns can facilitate overall interpretation.
2. **🚛 [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Cognitive Load]]:** Reducing the noise around the critical information helps page scanning.
3. **🍇 Benefits:** It’s easier to relate and understand something when it appeals to you.
4. **⚓️ Anchoring:** Comparisons are another great way to make sure people have the right frame of reference.
5. **🗑 Loss Aversion:** Highlighting what could happen in case of “non-action” is also an excellent way to help people understand what’s at stake.
6. **👀 Discoverability:** Making sure key elements are standing out.
7. **🧗‍♂️ Labor Illusion:** Showing the work that is done behind the scenes can help guide users.

- [[Anchors]] We tend to **depend heavily on an initial piece of information** (the anchor) to make subsequent decisions. Anchoring works with anything that can be evaluated.

- [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Loss Aversion]] We **hate losing** way more than we like winning. (ask Lance Armstrong). In other words, losing $500 will hurt more than the joy of gaining $500, hence why we buy insurance.
  **🔥 Pro tip:** Reframing things in terms of loss can generate actions. Make sure it also follows a clear benefit for people, so it doesn't only trigger negativity. [_Decision Lab_, Why do we buy insurance? (2009)](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/loss-aversion/)
- Discoverability It is the **ease at which users can find** features within a product. Good discoverability is critical because it directly **affects users' ability** to see and understand what can be done to take action.
