That relationship, between retailer, courier and customer,¬†is what makes this industry‚Äîwhere most providers sell essentially identical services‚Äîa great example to study.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è 5 ideas to make your forms easier to use

1. **‚ö°Ô∏èAuto-focus on first field.** When the page loads, don't force the user to click into the first field.
2. ‚å® **Select the right field data types** So that the operating system brings up the most suitable keyboard (e.g., numerical).
3. **üëâ Auto-proceed on suitable fields** If you're asking for a 6-digit code, auto-proceed once they've entered the 6th digit. 
4. **üá¨üáß Suggest sensible default options** For example, if the sender's address is in the UK, default to a UK phone number. 
5. **‚û°Ô∏è Utilise keyboard 'next' buttons** So it focuses on the next field, rather than just close the keyboard.


### ‚òîÔ∏è Why we all seek reassurance post-purchase
- **Providing Exit Points** Allow users to disengage from your product with a sense of¬†**completion**.In the context of addicting products, it's the ethical thing to do (as you'll see in Mod. 4). And in the context of transactional products like here, it's a way to keep users sane. If not, people will associate your product to a¬†**never-ending treadmill**‚Äîwhich may hurt your long-term user retention.

After ordering a new card on Revolut, you'll see this, which serves both as a reassuring reminder, and a tracking link.

Let's summarise why this is so¬†**effective at reducing both anxiety**, and the [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Cognitive Load]]
- **üö¶It shows the current status** i.e., the order is in progress.
- **üöó It explains the process** i.e., the next step is for Revolut to post your card.
- **‚åõÔ∏è Gives context about the timeline** i.e., estimated to arrive on the 8th.
- **üì¶ A status with permanence** i.e., you're reassured that you can always come back here to check the tracking status.
