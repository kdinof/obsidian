## Step 1: Growth as IC 

1. **Dive deep into business, regardless of your role or title.** Understanding how the business operates is essential, and it’s not only a job for C-level leadership or Product Managers. Having a business-related education, it was natural for me to combine both PM and Design hats when creating the product experience. You don’t need any permission to start asking business-related questions, dive into raw data, and operate with a mental model of a “mini-CEO.”
    
2. **Knock the door to join all possible leadership meetings.** It’s not always natural for leadership to involve individual contributors in strategic meetings, but I believe it’s essential if you want to build a reliable team and mutual trust. For the first several months, I remember having a physical notebook where I wrote down everything related to strategy, metrics, and unknown terms like WAU, NSM, and ARR and creating a personal knowledge base — this extreme curiosity helped me in the beginning.
    
3. **Start with “Yes” to get more opportunities, then prioritize and delegate.** Over my first 2 years in the company, I was an individual contributor in 3 to 4 teams simultaneously (several Growth teams, Enterprise, and Miro Labs). It was incredibly intense, but it afforded me a tremendous opportunity to not only learn the field but also master managing a substantial scope by myself. Later on, it became a great foundation for creating prioritization and planning frameworks, as well as operationalizing that scope within a bigger team.
    
4. **Build your own growth while keeping your manager a supportive partner.** Career transitions and promotions are not the responsibility of a manager. Being proactive and intentional about that in the first years is essential. When there was no performance review process at Miro, I created a simple ritual — showing my vision about the role, scope, skills, and responsibilities every 6 months and co-create opportunities to explore the next steps with my manager. I’m also grateful to have supportive partners in leadership and advocates who understand the process.
    
5. **Create your own role by combining business goals with your passions.** That one became a recipe for having enormous curiosity and passion to stick with one company for a long, and I think it’s important to tell about that in detail below.

## Step 2: Transitioning to Manager

- **Make hiring #1 priority for the first year, and hire bar-raisers.** You can’t deliver excellent products at scale by doing everything hands-on — you need a strong team. Missteps in hiring can cost months or even years. At the stage of hyper-growth, it’s becoming essential to level up the seniority of the whole team, and most important to bring bar-raisers with an open mindset to uplift the experience of the whole team. I learned that matching individuals with different seniority levels is also crucial, and huge seniority gaps between PM and Designer can require a lot of leadership involvement. I find it valuable to pair individuals with different levels while coaching both on how to make this partnership efficient.
    
- **Hire teams, not isolated individuals.** I didn’t know that in the beginning. I was optimizing for pure talent rather than how exactly a group of various individuals will operate successfully in a team. At the stage of hyper-growth, the teams require a particular mindset, and the job of a hiring manager requires psychological knowledge to understand humans, not just reading their CVs. If I do that again, I would align even deeper and more rigorously with Product and Engineering partners on cross-functional team structure and skillset by asking: "What business outcomes do we expect from this team 1 year from now? What are the unique skills we’re lacking in the current team and want to bring from external? How do we imagine the growth and career path for these individuals for the next 1-3 years?". The framework "Optimisers, Builders, Strategists" from [Elena Verna](https://open.substack.com/users/3478323-elena-verna?utm_source=mentions)would be extremely useful at that time to align on expectations.
    
- **Shift yourself from IC work as soon as possible.** As Julie Zhou said in her book, managing both can be quite dangerous. I learned that in practice. Having a variable scope of work and exciting projects was fulfilling, and I didn’t want to share it with others first. But can you produce great outcomes for the business by trying to deliver in 3 teams simultaneously with increasing complexity? The answer is "No". By not holding off the hands-on responsibilities, you are not allocating enough space for learning how to become a manager, and it will harm the brand-new team you’re building.
    
- **Provide guidance rather than dictating solutions.** This is the most tricky part for new Product Design Leaders who are literally "thinking" with solutions in mind. Each time on a review session I tried to catch myself and rephrase the "solution" into "direction".
    
- **Give everybody else the voice in the room, and speak last.** That was not obvious to me in the beginning. I learned that from the new teammate, and this feedback was a gift. Simply swapping the approach and asking everybody else to share their feedback about solutions, then summarizing and adding my direction was a significant multiplier to boost the group collaboration and creativity.

## Step 3: Leadership at scale

1. **Give the team enough freedom to build autonomy.** For me, as a person who tries to keep everything under control, it was not easy at all. Over time, I learned how to give the team more responsibilities to prioritize, give them more freedom to make mistakes and learn from them. At some point, the team starts operating as an autonomous unit, and the role of a leader changes to supporting this "continuous learning" culture at a bigger scale.
    
2. **Praise the team's achievements and "operate in service of others".** There's an idea of an "umbrella manager" who is trying to create a feeling of clarity and safety in a highly complex environment. It's important to find time and be approachable for the team at scale and also establish additional "time for recognition." It can be a simple weekly ritual or also a bigger event that I used to call "The Time to Praise" and host it on New Year's Eve. That way, the team can share gratitude and feedback as a gift and make it meaningful to inform somebody else's plans for the upcoming year in a form that is way better than a typical performance review.
    
3. **Help your teams align by building internal "shortcuts" and connections.** A typical example from my experience is alignment between Growth and Core functions, which is quite essential to building consistent experiences. It's a unique feature of people who have been long in a company, as they have "shortcut" connections that can save days or weeks for new teammates in reaching that alignment. Using that strength and proactively sharing these valuable connections will create extra clarity for the team in a highly complex and uncertain environment.
    
4. **"Inspire" over just "Manage"**. Finally, leadership at scale can become quite operational. There is a concept of "creative leadership" that requires leaders to be more like inspiring coaches who also provide meaningful creative guidance to individuals. It also requires having enormous energy that can be invested into human connections beyond demanding business priorities.
