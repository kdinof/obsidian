## Introduction

### The Missing Layer: Why even brilliant ideas fail [[1. Introduction]]
- "You need to know how you can make people choose for you. You need to understand how you can move people in the direction in which you want them to move. You need to know how to get people to start (or stop) doing things. Or to get yourself to do so."
- "It is all about giving you the method to uncover that hidden, irrational logic in human decision‐making which is the key to moving people into the right direction."

### It is all about influence [[2. Influence]]
- "The way supermarkets position the products upon their shelves, is an attempt to influence your buying behaviour. When you give someone a gift or a compliment, you influence his or her ‘liking behaviour’."
- **"Although influencing behaviour is our daily mechanism to cope, learn, progress and connect in life, we have a blind spot for how influence works"**
- =="Most of the time, we don’t realise it. We all tend to think that we make our own decisions based on our own free will every day. However, most of our behaviour is thoughtfully triggered, and our choices are carefully designed."==
- "Do you check your phone or email when you see the red notification light up? Do you go for the mid-priced wine on a restaurant menu? Do you follow the route in an Ikea store? Eat a whole bag of potato chips, instead of having just a few crisps? Buy something while you didn’t have the budget for it? The way you buy, vote, walk, eat, work, interact, shop, react, look, is often discreetly designed and carefully crafted, using the science of influence."

### Behavioural science made practical
- **"Principles of persuasion alone won’t do the trick, aka ‘what this book is not’"**
- "this room was already booked 235 times, and had an 8.7 rating’) and scarcity (‘only three bedrooms left’). These are powerful principles, but sometimes they are mere ‘tricks’ up a designer’s sleeve in order to boost sales."
- "You first need to know why people do things, and why they don’t. Successful influence begins with a deep understanding of the human decision‐making that shapes behaviours."
- **"Every behaviour starts with a decision. People must make the decision to start or to stop doing things"**

### The SUE | Behavioural Design Method
- "This book will show you how to apply behavioural science systematically and pragmatically."

## Foundation

- "How come parents in serious debt still buy expensive toys for their kids? Why do even the most highly motivated people drop out of exercise routines? How come organ donation compliance is 99% in some countries, and in others only 4%? How come patients are more inclined to honour doctor’s visits if the doctor’s assistant does not write down their appointments? Why doesn’t giving your talent a raise in salary make them more loyal? Why do people with far too high mortgages still book expensive holidays? Why do people with higher social security numbers make higher bids at auctions than people with lower social security numbers? How come sales volumes often go up instead of down when products are actually made more expensive instead of cheaper?"
- **"The science of influence, behavioural economics, or behavioural psychology, is the study of how people make decisions that lead to various behaviours."**

- "The first ingredient of successful Behavioural Design may hurt a bit. If you want to design behaviour, it isn’t about you or your product, brand or plan. Well, at least not in the first place. It’s also all about the people you are trying to influence."
- "Most of the time, marketeers, business owners, executives or policymakers are thinking inside‐out – they look at their brand, product, service or policy, and wonder how they might convince people to embrace it. They come up with brand positioning, unique selling points and (product) benefits. In this book I would like to propose the opposite approach: outside‐in thinking. Outside‐in thinking takes the humans behind the customer, citizen, employee as a starting point, and tries to gain a deep understanding of their goals, needs, barriers and hopes. These are often not logical but psychological."
- "Inside‐out and outside‐in"
- **"The secret of designing behaviour: Thinking outside‐in"**
- "Therefore, the starting point of outside‐in thinking is the psychology of your target group."

- **"If you want to move people into the direction you need them to move in, you first have to understand what it is that moves people"**
- **"And one of the most well-known models that you’ve perhaps been taught is the AIDA-model (attention, interest, desire, action)"**

### Page 28
- **"You can change attitudes by changing behaviour first"**
- "To illustrate this: if I want you to separate your waste, I could start by giving you information on how this behaviour would contribute to a better living environment. I could give you accurate ‘stats’ on how much CO2-emission this will save, and how your waste will be transformed into new products that also can be useful to you, and hoping this will change your attitude to recycling. However, I could also trigger you into separating your garbage by making this extremely easy for you. We know from research that if you have acted in a certain way – in this case by recycling – your mind adapts how you see yourself. If you separate your waste, you are likely to say ‘yes’ if someone asks you if you consider yourself ‘environmentally involved’. Your attitude will match your behaviour. This is often a more effective strategy than the other way round."

- **"Behavioural Design is all about creating a context based on deep human understanding, that triggers people to make a decision or take action towards their goals"**
- **"On a high level, Behavioural Design is about combining the way designers solve problems with the science of influence"**
- "It can be used to nudge people towards a desired behaviour, or help people to abandon an undesired behaviour–and thus aid them in shaping ‘an autopilot routine’ also known as a habit."

### Page 30
- "Behavioural Design is where the world of creativity and science collide, creating a magical and potent mix. It’s like a marriage of perfect partners you enviously observe."
- "That’s where design thinking comes in. You may have heard of design thinking before. Design thinking comes from innovation and is a new approach, or process if you like, to solve problems taking the user as a focusing point."

- "Some years ago, a truck driver made a bad judgment and tried to pass under a low bridge that turned out to be too low for his truck. His truck got so firmly jammed under the bridge, that he couldn’t manoeuvre the truck through it anymore, but also couldn’t reverse his vehicle. Traffic came to a halt behind and in front of him, so there was a problem. The story goes that the fire department, other truck drivers, road assistance, and various experts came along to discuss how to tackle this problem. Everyone was debating whether it was a good idea to dismantle parts of the truck, or else to dismantle the bridge parts. Everyone came up with a solution that fitted into their respective expertise. This went on for some time. A boy walked by, looked at the truck and then suggested, ‘Why not just let the air out of the tires?’ which took all the specialists and experts by surprise, who had been debating for hours in trying to solve the problem. When they tested the solution, the truck was able to drive through quick enough."

- "And it summarised what [[Design thinking 1]] helps you to realise: that thinking about design enables you to change how you tackle problems. It encourages you to explore new alternatives, creating options that didn’t exist before."
- "Design thinking regards understanding, exploring and development as the three overlapping ‘cycles’."
- "Make this process in my team"

### Page 33
- **"‘If you don’t experiment and fail to learn–well, you’re simply maximizing your risk to fail big’"**
- "I believe that the best strategy is developed through ideation and prototyping [[Pretotype it]]. Sometimes the feedback you get in prototyping gives you extra insight into the consumer’s decision-making process. You have to make a perception switch, and come to a new understanding that will reshape your strategy. I like to call this ‘a process of inclusion and being open to human psychology’: so: the concept of strategy development instead of the more inside‐out concept of strategic planning, which is a finished process after the strategy has been set."

- **"Behavioural Design Thinking is the process of design thinking powered by behavioural science"**

### Page 35
- "By placing behavioural science within the stage of understanding design thinking, you’ll get much stronger insights that will help you to reveal the subconscious powers shaping behaviour."
- "By adding behavioural science to the explorative phase, you’re not simply developing creative ideas but by ideas that will change behaviour. By applying behavioural science at the developing phase, you’ll make your final concepts far more effective."

### Page 37
- **"Behavioural Design is designing a context in which it is easier for people to make decisions or engage in behaviours that will help them improve their work, private life or living environment"**

### Page 38
- **"Human-centred thinkers are looking for problems to solve; customer-centred thinkers are looking to find a better way of selling their solutions"**
- **"If you want to become a prime Behavioural Designer, you need to fall in love with the problem"**
- "the difference between a great team and an average team is precisely this. The great teams fall in love with the problem. If a solution doesn’t work, they are still fascinated by the problem, and keep on developing new solutions. The teams captivated by their solution are entirely at odds and demotivated when it fails."

### Page 39
- **"As a Behavioural Designer, you have one aim: Getting to know the human being behind your customer"**

### Page 40
- "Therefore, I would like to urge you, should you intend to influence minds and shape behaviour, to forget about any traditional personas, but to start thinking in behavioural patterns instead."

### Page 42
- **"While traditional personas represent one ideal fictional customer to target, behavioural patterns are based on what real people do, how they do it and why"**
- "Taking on a human-centric approach is your free ticket to be unlimitedly curious, observe people, and ask people all kinds of questions as part of your job. That’s what makes thinking about Behavioural Design such fun, and at the same time so rewarding. If you start by understanding the research tested on human decision-making and human behaviour, you can find the generalities in your differentiated target groups. And you can put strategies and ideas into place that make all kinds of people say ‘yes – even Vera does this!’"
- **"We are all different, but in many ways, our brains react to and prompt to action in the same manner"**
