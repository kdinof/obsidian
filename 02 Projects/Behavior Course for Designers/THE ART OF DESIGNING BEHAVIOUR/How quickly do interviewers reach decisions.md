# Introduction

The paper examines how quickly interviewers make decisions about job applicants, exploring factors influencing decision-making time. It addresses a common belief that interviewers often make quick ("snap") judgments during interviews, potentially undermining fairness and accuracy.

## Theoretical Framework

The study uses Cognitive Load Theory, proposing that decision-making times vary based on the cognitive demands placed on interviewers. Specifically, structured interviews (with standardized questions and evaluation criteria) require more deliberate information processing, leading to longer decision times, whereas less structured interviews with more rapport-building may facilitate quicker decisions. It also examines interviewer characteristics, such as experience, training, and interviewing efficacy, influencing decision speed.

## Methodology

- **Participants:** 166 interviewers evaluated 691 applicants at a university career center.
- **Procedure:**
    - Interviewers completed questionnaires regarding their interviewing practices and personal attributes.
    - Interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes, and decision-making times were self-reported immediately afterward.
- **Measures:**
    - **Decision-making time:** Rated on a scale from immediate (within the first minute) to decisions made after the interview.
    - **Interview Structure:** Measured through question sophistication, question consistency, evaluation standardization, and rapport-building practices.
    - **Interviewer Characteristics:** Interviewer experience, efficacy, and training were evaluated.

## Results

- **Decision-Making Speed:**
    
    - Few decisions were made rapidly: only 4.9% within the first minute and 25.5% within the first 5 minutes. About 70% of decisions occurred after 5 minutes or post-interview.
- **Influence of Interview Structure:**
    
    - **Question consistency** (asking all candidates identical questions) significantly increased decision-making time, as it demanded higher cognitive effort.
    - **Rapport Building** (less structured interviews) was linked to quicker decisions.
    - **Question sophistication** and **evaluation standardization** did not significantly impact decision speed.
- **Interviewer Differences:**
    
    - **Interviewers with higher efficacy and more experience** made quicker decisions.
    - **Training level** did not significantly impact decision time, although interactions showed that training reduced quick decisions associated with rapport-building and question sophistication.
- **Interview Order:**
    
    - A curvilinear relationship emerged: decision time increased initially with each successive interview but decreased after approximately four interviews due to cognitive fatigue, shifting interviewers from controlled to automatic processing.

## Implications

- **For Practice:**
    
    - Rapid decisions are less frequent than commonly assumed.
    - Interviewers should be trained or reminded to thoroughly evaluate applicants throughout the interview duration.
    - Organizations could benefit from limiting interviewers to approximately four interviews in succession to prevent cognitive fatigue and reliance on automatic schemas.
- **For Research:**
    
    - Future studies should further examine decision-making dynamics over successive interviews and explore personality or demographic factors that influence interviewer decision-making speed.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that quick decision-making in interviews may be overstated, identifies factors influencing decision-making speed (interviewer experience, efficacy, rapport building, and interview structure), and provides practical recommendations for improving interview procedures and decision-making accuracy.

The findings highlight that interview decision-making is complex and influenced by both the interview context and interviewer characteristics, providing insights for optimizing interview practices in organizations.

## üîç **Key Factors from the Research:**

The study identifies three critical factors influencing how quickly interviewers make their hiring decisions:

1. **Interview Structure (especially Question Consistency and Rapport Building)**
2. **Interviewer's Experience**
3. **Interviewer's Efficacy**

## üìå **Detailed Explanation & Practical Recommendations:**

### 1. **Interview Structure**

Interviews vary in their level of structure, affecting how quickly decisions are made. The two notable elements discussed in the study are:

### a. **Question Consistency**

- **Definition:** Interviewers use a fixed list of questions for all candidates.
- **Effect:** Increases decision-making time, as interviewers systematically process responses.
- **Implication for you:**
    - Structured interviews offer you more time to demonstrate your suitability. **Use each opportunity to give structured, detailed, and relevant responses.**
    - Prepare specific, clear, and concise examples that directly relate to the job requirements, anticipating structured, standardized questions (e.g., ‚ÄúDescribe a situation when‚Ä¶‚Äù).

### **Example from the research:**

Interviewers strictly using a standardized set of questions took significantly more time to decide, indicating a detailed, deliberative evaluation of candidates.

### b. **Rapport Building**

- **Definition:** Casual conversation or small talk that puts you at ease but can influence quick, intuitive decisions.
    
- **Effect:** Shortens decision-making time, sometimes based on initial impressions or emotional connections.
    
- **Implication for you:**
    
    - Leverage rapport-building phases effectively to create a positive first impression.
    - Be well-prepared to engage confidently in casual conversations, making positive personal impressions early on.
- **Example from the research:**  
    Interviewers who engaged extensively in rapport-building tended to make quicker, potentially less systematic decisions based on initial impressions.

## üéì **Interviewer Characteristics:**

The study highlights that the interviewer‚Äôs background directly affects decision speed:

### a. **Interviewing Efficacy**

- **Definition:** Interviewers' confidence in their own ability to select suitable candidates.
- **Effect:** Higher interviewer efficacy leads to quicker decision-making due to reliance on established mental schemas.
- **Implication for you:**
    - Experienced and confident interviewers might quickly form strong initial impressions. Therefore, creating an immediate positive impression at the start of the interview is crucial.
    - **Clearly demonstrate your suitability early on** (e.g., confidently summarize your strengths and relevant experiences concisely at the start).

**Example from the research:**  
Interviewers with high self-efficacy were quicker decision-makers due to their confidence and developed schema about ideal candidate qualities.

### b. **Interviewing Experience**

- **Definition:** Length and amount of previous interviewing experience.
- **Effect:** Experienced interviewers make quicker decisions because they rely on developed schemas to streamline information processing.
- **Implication for you:**
    - Prepare concise, impactful answers. Experienced interviewers quickly evaluate candidates, so early performance in the interview (the first few questions) is critical.
    - **Provide direct, clear answers from the outset to match their evaluation schemas.**

**Example from the research:**  
Experienced interviewers reached hiring decisions more quickly, having established clear expectations from previous experiences.

## üìà **Interview Order & Cognitive Load:**

- **Finding:** Interviewers spent longer deciding about early applicants (first 3‚Äì4 interviews), after which decision time gradually decreased.
- **Implication for you:**
    - If you are interviewing early, interviewers may spend more time evaluating you carefully, which could be advantageous if you have good responses prepared.
    - If your interview is later in the day, interviewers might decide faster due to cognitive fatigue. **Start strong and clearly articulate your unique value early on.**

**Example from the research:**  
Interview decision times were longer for initial applicants (first ~4 interviews), and interviewers tended to speed up decisions afterward, possibly due to cognitive load and schema-based shortcuts.
