Let's dive deeper into a structured comparison of the specific steps within **Design Thinking** and the **SUE Behavioural Design Method**, clearly outlining similarities, differences, and how they relate to each other in practice.

## **Design Thinking vs. SUE Behavioural Design Method: Steps Comparison**

### Overview of both methods:

|**Design Thinking** (Stanford Model)|**SUE Behavioural Design Method** (Astrid Groenewegen)|
|---|---|
|1. Empathise|1. Insight|
|2. Define|2. Intervention|
|3. Ideate|3. Impact|
|4. Prototype|4. Implement|
|5. Test||


While Design Thinking uses 5 iterative phases, the SUE Method organises the process into 4 clear steps, each containing specific behavioural sub-steps. Below, we examine these in more detail.

## Detailed Comparison:

### Step 1: Understanding the User

|**Design Thinking: "Empathise"**|**SUE Method: "Insight"**|
|---|---|
|- Deep empathy for users' needs and problems|- Deep understanding of decision-making and behaviours|
|- Observation, ethnography, user interviews|- Interviews, behavioural analysis, understanding human psychology|
|- Gather qualitative data|- Collects qualitative data using the Influence Framework (Pains, Gains, Anxieties, Comforts)|
|- Goal: Understand user's lived experience|- Goal: Understand user's underlying motivations and actual behaviour|

**Similarity:**  
Both methods emphasize beginning with in-depth qualitative research and empathy for users.

**Key difference:**

- **Design Thinking** broadly empathizes with users to understand their experiences holistically.
- **SUE Method** specifically investigates how underlying psychological forces influence decisions and behaviours, structured by the Influence Framework (Pains, Gains, Anxieties, Comforts).

### Step 2: Clarifying the Problem & Finding Solutions

|**Design Thinking: "Define & Ideate"**|**SUE Method: "Intervention"**|
|---|---|
|- Clearly defining the user's problems|- Clearly identifying behavioural opportunities to change|
|- Creating a precise problem statement|- Formulating behavioural objectives (Behavioural Statement)|
|- Brainstorming multiple solutions openly|- Ideating specific behavioural interventions using the SWAC Tool (Spark, Want, Ability, Comfort)|
|- "How Might We" statements|- Using similar creative prompts ("How Might We" questions)|

**Similarity:**  
Both use creative ideation and define clear problem statements to inspire actionable ideas.

**Key difference:**

- **Design Thinking** has separate stages for clearly defining the problem (Define) and openly generating ideas (Ideate).
- The **SUE Method** merges defining and ideation, specifically orienting ideas towards behavioural outcomes, guided by behavioural science (SWAC tool).

---

### Step 3: Experimentation & Refinement

|**Design Thinking: "Prototype & Test"**|**SUE Method: "Impact"**|
|---|---|
|- Quickly build tangible prototypes|- Build behavioural prototypes (interventions)|
|- Test solutions through user interaction|- Test interventions through experiments with users|
|- Rapid feedback cycles for refinement|- Structured approach to learning from real-world results|
|- Iteratively refine ideas based on real feedback|- Iteratively refine behavioural interventions based on actual behavioural data|

**Similarity:**  
Both approaches emphasize testing with real people, quickly learning and iterating based on direct feedback.

**Key difference:**

- **Design Thinking** prototypes are often broader, physical or digital representations of solutions.
- The **SUE Method** prototypes are explicitly designed to test behavioural assumptions and refine behavioural interventions.

---

### Step 4: Implementation & Ethics (Unique to SUE)

|**Design Thinking**|**SUE Method: "Implement"**|
|---|---|
|- Implementation often considered post-process, or integrated into prototype-testing cycles|- Explicit stage dedicated to implementation, scaling solutions, and ethics|
|- Scaling solutions often implicit|- Explicitly addresses how behavioural interventions scale effectively and ethically|
|- Ethics implicitly guided by empathy principles|- Strong, explicit ethical component built into the process|

**Key difference:**

- **Design Thinking** implicitly considers implementation through iterative refinement.
- The **SUE Method** explicitly focuses on implementation, scalability, and ethical considerations, making behavioural ethics a mandatory final check.

## How do the steps relate in practice?

Let's visualize the relationship clearly:

|**User-Centric Step**|**Design Thinking**|**SUE Method**|**Overlap**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Understanding Users|Empathise|Insight|User research, interviews, qualitative analysis|
|Clarifying Problems & Ideation|Define → Ideate|Intervention|Clear problem definition, creative ideation|
|Prototyping & Testing|Prototype → Test|Impact|Testing with real users, iterative learning|
|Implementation|_(Implicit)_|Implement|_(Implementation explicit in SUE Method)_|

---

## Summary: Comparative Strengths and Structure

Both methods are structured processes aimed at systematically solving human-centred problems. They strongly overlap at key stages (user understanding, ideation, prototyping and testing). The primary differences are:

- **Design Thinking**:
    
    - Is broader in scope, applicable across diverse domains.
    - Iterative structure encourages flexible movement between stages.
    - Ethics and implementation are implicit, embedded within iterations and empathy.
- **SUE Behavioural Design Method**:
    
    - Highly specialized around influencing behaviours, explicitly leveraging behavioural psychology insights.
    - Each step is clearly defined and guided by structured tools (Influence Framework, SWAC).
    - Implementation and ethics explicitly built into the methodology.

---

## Practical implications of these differences:

- If your challenge broadly involves user experience, product development, or innovation beyond behavioural aspects, **Design Thinking** provides great flexibility and wide-ranging tools.
    
- If your objective is specifically behavioural change—designing interventions to actively shift user choices or behaviours—the **SUE Behavioural Design Method** offers deeper, specialized guidance.
    

However, the two methodologies are not mutually exclusive. Integrating Design Thinking’s broader empathy and iterative approach with the SUE Method’s behavioural specificity and structured influence frameworks can significantly enhance project outcomes.

## Final thoughts:

Both approaches have proven effective. Choosing between them (or combining them) depends largely on your specific project goal:

- For comprehensive innovation: start with **Design Thinking**.
- For behavioural clarity and effectiveness: incorporate elements from the **SUE Method**.

By clearly understanding and combining strengths from each approach, you'll gain powerful, structured frameworks to effectively design for human needs and behaviour.
