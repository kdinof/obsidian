# Task
_AI Orientation & Goal Setting._ 
- ✅ In the morning, have a 10-minute conversation with ChatGPT (text or voice via a tool) about your interests or about the news article from Day 1. Treat it like a casual chat – focus on communicating, not on being perfect. Afterwards, ask the AI to point out a couple of mistakes you made or new phrases you could use. 
- ✅ **Vocabulary:** From Day 1’s reading and today’s chat, compile 5–10 new words or expressions. Create flashcards for them (you can have ChatGPT generate example sentences for each word). 
- **Listening:** Watch a short YouTube video (3–5 minutes) by an American creator on a topic you enjoy (e.g. a tech review, a cooking recipe). Turn on English subtitles. After watching, summarize aloud what you learned – then check the video description or comments for any details you missed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcpnHxuNeSE
- 
- _Time:_ 15 min AI chat, 15 min vocab, 20 min video & summary, 10 min flashcard review.

### **Mistakes and Corrections**

1. **"I was the first day..."**  
    → _It was the first day of my 3-month English level-up challenge._  
    **Explanation:** "I was" should be "It was" because you're talking about a day.
    
2. **"I'm really commited to this goal"**  
    → _I'm really committed to this goal._  
    **Explanation:** Spelling mistake – “commited” should be “committed” (double 't').
    
3. **"Because the goal moving to Kuala Lumpur is the best thing..."**  
    → _Because the goal of moving to Kuala Lumpur is the most important thing I need to focus on right now._  
    **Explanation:** Add "of" after "goal" and rephrase "the best thing" to make it more natural and clearer.
    
4. **"This goal fits to our famaly values"**  
    → _This goal fits our family values._  
    **Explanation:** Remove “to” after “fits” and correct spelling of “famaly” → “family.”
    
5. **"I tried becaus of a lot of things..."**  
    → _I got tired because of a lot of things we had to deal with at our company._  
    **Explanation:** Clarified meaning and fixed "tried" (should be "tired"), "becaus" → "because".
    
6. **"It really hard to have a business..."**  
    → _It's really hard to run a business..._  
    **Explanation:** Add “It’s” for a full sentence. “Have a business” can be improved to “run a business.”
    
7. **"especially the don't functioning in reality"**  
    → _especially when things don't work in reality._  
    **Explanation:** Rewritten for grammar and clarity.
    
8. **"I also read an article as a part of my English challenge..."**  
    → _I also read an article as part of my English challenge..._  
    **Explanation:** “as part of” is the correct phrase (no “a”).
    
9. **"It was a feeling like..."**  
    → _It gave me the feeling that..._  
    **Explanation:** More natural phrasing in English.
    
10. **"what I went to learn"**  
    → _what I want to learn_  
    **Explanation:** Typo – “went” should be “want.”
    
11. **"this is what I will really passionate about"**  
    → _this is what I will be really passionate about_  
    **Explanation:** Missing verb “be.”
    
12. **"people little bit happier"**  
    → _people a little bit happier_  
    **Explanation:** Add article “a”.
    
13. **"Roey Sutherland he is working at..."**  
    → _Rory Sutherland, who works at..._  
    **Explanation:** Remove the second subject (“he”) and improve grammar.
    
14. **"importance, easiness of Behavior Science"**  
    → _importance and simplicity of behavioral science_  
    **Explanation:** “Easiness” is not natural here. Use “simplicity” or “accessibility”. Also, "behavior science" should be "behavioral science".
    
15. **"an why everybody"**  
    → _and why everybody_  
    **Explanation:** Spelling mistake – “an” should be “and”.
    
16. **"told before"**  
    → _said before_ or _mentioned before_  
    **Explanation:** "Told" is often used with a person (e.g. told _you_). “Said” or “mentioned” fits better here.
    
17. **"all things connected together"**  
    → _everything is connected_ or _all things are connected_  
    **Explanation:** Simplify for clarity and grammar.
    
18. **"dive into BS"**  
    → _dive into behavioral science_  
    **Explanation:** Avoid abbreviating "BS" – it can be misunderstood as slang.
    
19. **"using this knowledge"**  
    → _by applying this knowledge_  
    **Explanation:** “Using” is okay, but “applying” is a more advanced and specific word here.

### **Grammar Topics to Focus On**

1. **Verb Tenses**
    
    - “was” vs. “it was” / “went” vs. “want” / “is” vs. “it’s”
2. **Verb Forms**
    
    - Be careful with structures like “what I will passionate about” → needs “be” verb.
3. **Prepositions**
    
    - “fits to” → “fits”, “as a part” → “as part”, “deal with”
4. **Articles**
    
    - “a little bit”, “a business”, “the importance”
5. **Subject-Verb Agreement**
    
    - “It really hard” → “It’s really hard”
6. **Word Order and Clarity**
    
    - Some sentences need reordering for clearer meaning.

so this is a rewritten version of the video about 10 mistakes of founders  i would like to provide a recap of a video i recently watched called 10 mistakes founder make  when pitching to investors i don't remember all of them but i will share the key points to  stood out of me the first one don't answer questions too directly instead of responding  to investor questions at face value try to understand the motivation behind the question  focus on the intention or the deep meaning not just the surface level topic for example  when a investor asks why are you working together as a team they are not simply asking where or how you  work what they really want to know is why you choose this specific people to build the company with you  the second mistake avoid being overly verbose talking too much is a common mistake keep your answers  conscious and to the point make space for follow-up questions this encourage that a two-way  communication and shows that you're confident in your message be authentic don't try to imitate famous  customers like steve jobs investors can easily tell when someone is pretending instead be genie you  really you your real personality and patient are more convincing than a imitation  uh don't over explain your product avoid the temptation to present every feature focus and stand on most  impressive aspects the one that create a vowel effect highlight only what truly set your product apart  communicate clearly and simply imagine you're explaining your idea to a five year old investor may not be  experts in your field so use simple language to and clean logic if they don't understand your product  the one that create a vowel effect and they want to invest in it start strong structure your pitch  uh strategically begin with your most compelling points grab attention early by leading with your biggest  achievement or the most impressive part of your idea don't be afraid to share insights  some founders hesitate to reveal uh their secrets to investors but it's important to share unique elements  of your journey vision of your journey vision and product strategy this insights build trust and demonstrate the depth  of your thinking these are some of the key mistakes founders often make when pitching to investors  factors and understanding them can significantly improve the effectiveness of a pitch
