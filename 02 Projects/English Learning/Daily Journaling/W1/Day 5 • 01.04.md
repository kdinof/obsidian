# Task

Day 4:
 **Day 5:** _Writing & Feedback._ 
 - ✅ **Writing:** Write a short email or letter (150–200 words) on a given topic – for instance, write to a (fictional) American friend about how your week has been, or write a review of that sitcom episode. Then use an AI tool to proofread it. Carefully read the AI’s corrections/explanations (note any recurring mistakes like missing articles or preposition errors). Keep a log of these common mistakes to address. 
 - **Speaking:** Call upon the AI to act as a pronunciation coach today: read a paragraph from your Day 5 email out loud _to_ the AI (if using voice input) or record and send it. Ask the AI to evaluate your pronunciation or fluency. Some advanced AI can provide pronunciation scores or pinpoint difficult words. Alternatively, compare your recording to TTS output of the same text. 
 - ✅ **Vocabulary:** Add any new words from this week to your flashcards and do a quick review (by Day 5 you should have ~25–30 new terms from various sources). 
 
 _Time:_ 30 min writing, 15 min reviewing corrections, 15 min pronunciation practice, 10 min vocab.


# Retro 

**Sunday 30 MARCH**  
**WEEKLY**

This week was about setting ==new goals== %%new goals%%, increased salary, a couple of doctor visits, and the start of my English improvement journey. 
I realized two things this week: Bali isn’t a place we want to live in the long term. Three main and crucial things for us are healthcare, education, and ecology. And healthcare here isn’t good.  
The second thing I’ve realized is my English. After I got the rejection from Constructor I decided to push my English to the next level. Fortunately, now in the AI era, it isn’t as hard as it was 5 years ago.

So 2 thoughts: 
1. Bali is a temporary place for us. So we have to think about where we will move next time. 
2. I have to significantly improve my English.

I want to dive deep into why we came here for 3rd time and again, after 5 months, realized (again) that Bali isn’t the perfect place where we want to live. I’ll do it later.  
For our next destination, we decided to move to Kuala Lumpur. Before we move there, we have to make a list with all our requirements for the new place where we want to live and use research to answer all 3 of these 3 questions.

And why English? With good and solid English the market where I can work becomes wider.  
So now 2 thing that everybody should know – IT and English.

### **Mistakes and Corrections:**

1. **"setting new goal"**  
    → _setting new goals_  
    **Why:** "Goals" should be plural to match "setting" (you’re setting more than one).
    
2. **"increased sallary"**  
    → _increased salary_  
    **Why:** Spelling error – "salary" is the correct spelling.
    
3. **"couple of doctors visits"**  
    → _a couple of doctor’s visits_  
    **Why:** Needs the article "a", possessive form "doctor’s", and "visits" plural.
    
4. **"start of my English improvement journey"**  
    → _the start of my journey to improve my English_  
    **Why:** More natural phrasing and word order.
    
5. **"I realised two things this week"**  
    → _I realized two things this week_  
    **Why:** Use American spelling ("realized") if you're learning American English (if British, "realised" is fine).
    
6. **"Bali isn’t a place where we want to live for a long time."**  
    → _Bali isn’t a place we want to live in long-term._  
    **Why:** More natural phrasing in conversational English.
    
7. **"medicine here isn’t good."**  
    → _the healthcare here isn’t good_  
    **Why:** "Medicine" is vague; "healthcare" is more accurate in this context.
    
8. **"After I got rejection from constructor"**  
    → _After I got rejected by a contractor_  
    **Why:** "Rejection" is a noun, but "got rejected" is the correct verb phrase. Also, "constructor" should be "contractor" (if you mean someone in construction or a freelancer).
    
9. **"push my English to the next level"**  
    → _improve my English to the next level_  
    **Why:** "Push" is understandable, but "improve" fits better with language learning.
    
10. **"Fortunately now in Alexa it isn’t so hard"**  
    → _Fortunately, with Alexa, it isn’t as hard as it was 5 years ago_  
    **Why:** Clean up grammar and add commas for clarity.
    
11. **"Bali is temporary place"**  
    → _Bali is a temporary place_  
    **Why:** Missing article "a".
    
12. **"to dive deep into why we came here for 3rd time"**  
    → _to dive deeper into why we came here for the third time_  
    **Why:** Use "deeper" and write out "third" for formal writing.
    
13. **"after 5 month realised"**  
    → _after 5 months, realized_  
    **Why:** "Months" should be plural; add a comma after the time expression.
    
14. **"we decided to move to Kuala Limpur"**  
    → _we decided to move to Kuala Lumpur_  
    **Why:** Spelling mistake – it should be "Lumpur".
    
15. **"before we move there we have to make a list"**  
    → _before we move there, we need to make a list_  
    **Why:** Add a comma and "need to" sounds more natural.
    
16. **"requirements for the new place where we want to live"**  
    → _requirements for the new place we want to live in_  
    **Why:** More natural phrasing with correct preposition.
    
17. **"use research to answer on all 3 of these questions"**  
    → _use research to answer all three of these questions_  
    **Why:** "Answer" does not need "on"; write out numbers in formal writing.
    
18. **"With good and solid English the market where I can work becomes wider"**  
    → _With solid English skills, the job market opens up for me_  
    **Why:** More idiomatic and natural phrasing.
    
19. **"2 thing that everybody should know"**  
    → _two things that everyone should know_  
    **Why:** Use "two" in writing; "everyone" is more natural here.

### **Grammar Areas to Work On:**

- **Articles (a, an, the)**
    
    - "a temporary place" (not "temporary place")
        
    - "a couple of" instead of just "couple of"
        
- **Plural Nouns**
    
    - goal → goals
        
    - month → months
        
    - thing → things
        
- **Verb Tenses**
    
    - Use Present Perfect when talking about recent realizations:
        
        - "I have realized" instead of "I realised" (if the realization is still relevant now)
            
- **Prepositions**
    
    - live **in** a place
        
    - answer a question (not "answer on")
        
- **Spelling & Word Choice**
    
    - salary, Kuala Lumpur, contractor
