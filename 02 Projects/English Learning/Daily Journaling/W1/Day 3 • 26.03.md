Day 3: 
- ✅ Listening & Shadowing Focus. Listening: Pick a 5-minute segment of an American English podcast (or an interview). Use a tool (like Otter.ai or YouTube auto-captions) to get the transcript. Listen to the segment once just for gist. Then listen again, pausing after each sentence to shadow (repeat it, trying to mimic accent and intonation) (https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1380201.pdf#:~:text=graduation,As%20made%20clear). Record yourself while shadowing. Afterwards, play back your recording and compare it to the original audio – note any words that sounded off. If possible, use a speech-to-text tool on your recording; see if it transcribes accurately. 
- Reading: Read 4–5 pages of an American short story or graded reader. Underline any grammar structures that confuse you. Later, ask the AI to explain one or two of those sentences. 
- ✅ Spaced Repetition: Review your flashcards from Day 2 (and add any new words from today’s listening/reading). Time: 40 min listening/shadowing, 20 min reading, 10 min vocab review.

We're going to level with you. This video is merch trap. At the end of this video I'm going to show you some merch and we hope you buy it. But before that we're going to talk about a pencil. Family folklore says that the spirited man first world was pencil. He doesn't really believe that that his first word was pencil. But he nevertheless hopes it's true. Before it's anything it's lit into pencil. This week crisis passed one million views. Our first video to cross the seven figure threshold. And that's something. Before it was anything. It was lit in a pencil. So this batch of merch, this t-shirt and lightweight sweet shirt drop is about the spirited man's pencil.
