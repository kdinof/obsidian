# Task
**Baseline Assessment**
Complete a short writing task and a speaking task to evaluate your level. 
- ✅ For writing – compose a 200-word self-introduction or journal entry (“About me and why I want to improve English”). Submit this to an AI grammar checker or ChatGPT and note any corrections or suggestions it gives. 
- For speaking – record a 1–2 minute voice memo (or use voice-to-text) talking about the same topic. Save the transcript (if using voice-to-text) or have the AI transcribe it. Review the transcript for errors or words that didn’t get recognized (these indicate pronunciation issues). 
- ✅ Reading/Listening: Also, read a short American news article (e.g. from VOA Learning English or a CNN article) and then listen to a TTS reading of the same article to attune your ear. 
Time: ~30 min writing & review, 15 min speaking, 30 min reading/listening.

### **Mistakes and Corrections**

1. **"About me and Why I want to improve English"**  
    → Better: **"About Me and Why I Want to Improve My English"**  
    (Capitalize all main words in the title; add "my" before "English" for clarity.)
    
2. **"Hi, my name is Kiell."**  
    → Correct, just remove the strikethrough for clarity.
    
3. **"Now me and my family are living in Bali an waiting for birth of our second son."**  
    → Better: **"My family and I are currently living in Bali, waiting for the birth of our second son."**  
    (Use "My family and I" instead of "me and my family"; "an" → "and"; add "the" before "birth.")
    
4. **"I work at Click as a product design lead."**  
    → Correct.
    
5. **"Click is Uzbekistan based Fintec company."**  
    → Better: **"Click is an Uzbekistan-based fintech company."**  
    ("an" before vowel sound; "based" needs a hyphen; spelling: _fintech_.)
    
6. **"That is why I work remotely."**  
    → Correct.
    
7. **"To be honest I don't enjoy work at Click because I don't feel that I learn something new."**  
    → Better: **"To be honest, I don't enjoy working at Click because I don't feel like I'm learning anything new."**  
    (Use "working" instead of "work"; "feel like I'm learning" sounds more natural.)
    
8. **"I'm growing as a professional."**  
    → Correct!
    
9. **"Vice versa I feel that I'm downgrading in my knowledge and responsibilities."**  
    → Better: **"On the contrary, I feel like I'm regressing in my knowledge and responsibilities."**  
    ("Vice versa" isn’t used correctly here.)
    
10. **"That is why I started looking for the new opportunities."**  
    → Better: **"That's why I started looking for new opportunities."**  
    (Remove "the"; use contraction for natural tone.)
    
11. **"I have also already created my website, wrote 3 case studies, updated my LinkedIn account."**  
    → Better: **"I have already created my website, written three case studies, and updated my LinkedIn account."**  
    (Use **present perfect** with past participle: _written_, not _wrote_; use "and" to finish the list.)
    
12. **"I have made a lot of work."**  
    → Better: **"I have done a lot of work."**  
    (We say "do work", not "make work".)
    
13. **"My goal is to find work in foeign company where Russian language isn’t the primary one."**  
    → Better: **"My goal is to find a job in a foreign company where Russian isn't the primary language."**  
    (Fix spelling of "foreign"; use "a job" instead of "work" for clarity.)
    
14. **"I already had 3–4 interview and got resections everywhere."**  
    → Better: **"I’ve already had 3–4 interviews and received rejections from all of them."**  
    ("Interview" → plural; use present perfect; spelling: _rejections_.)
    
15. **"I believe that the main skill to grow is English."**  
    → Better: **"I believe that the most important skill to improve is my English."**
    
16. **"Because when I'm telling my case studies I feel that I'm not confident in my speech and story that I tell is messy and awkward."**  
    → Better: **"When I present my case studies, I feel that I'm not confident, and the way I speak is messy and awkward."**
    
17. **"And this is why I want to improve my English – just to get a new job."**  
    → Better: **"That's why I want to improve my English – to get a new job."**

### **Grammar Areas to Focus On**

1. **Present Perfect Tense**
    
    - _I have made_, _I have done_, _I have already created_
    - Practice using **have/has + past participle**
2. **Gerunds After Verbs**
    
    - _enjoy working_, not _enjoy work_
    - _feel like learning_, not _feel that I learn_
3. **Articles (a/an/the)**
    
    - _a job_, _the birth_, _an Uzbekistan-based company_
4. **Word Order & Sentence Structure**
    
    - Avoid starting with “Because” unless you continue the sentence
    - Use conjunctions (and, but) to connect ideas smoothly
5. **Plural Nouns**
    
    - _interviews_, not _interview_
    - _rejections_, not _resections_
