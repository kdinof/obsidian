# Task

- **Day 7:** _Light Practice & Rest._ On the seventh day, do a relaxed review to consolidate the week. For example, play a vocabulary game on your phone (Quizlet match, Duolingo, etc.) using the words you learned. 
- Engage in a **free conversation with the AI** about any topic you like (no pressure, just chat for fun – e.g. talk about your plans for next week or ask the AI to tell a joke and respond to it). If you feel energetic, you can redo any favorite activity from earlier in the week. 
- Otherwise, keep it light – maybe watch a movie in English (with subtitles) or read an American blog article for enjoyment. The idea is to not burn out, but still get some English input. _Time:_ 30–60 minutes relaxed input or chat.

**End of Week 1 Check:** 
You should have a clearer idea of your current proficiency and which skills need the most work. You’ve established a study routine and used AI tools in multiple ways. By now, you’ve learned ~30 new words, refreshed some grammar points, and hopefully feel more _comfortable_ engaging with English daily. Save your Week 1 writing sample and audio recording – you’ll compare them with later weeks to gauge improvement.

## Grammar Areas to Improve

Based on your weekly tasks and corrections, focus on the following key grammar areas:

- **Articles:**
  - Ensure consistent use of “a,” “an,” and “the” (e.g., “a temporary place,” “the birth of our second son”).

- **Verb Tenses & Forms:**
  - **Present Perfect:** Use “have/has + past participle” (e.g., “I have created” instead of “I wrote”).
  - **Gerunds:** Use gerunds after certain verbs (e.g., “enjoy working” rather than “enjoy work”).
  - **Verb Consistency:** Maintain consistent verb tenses within sentences and across related ideas.

- **Word Order & Sentence Structure:**
  - Arrange subjects for natural phrasing (e.g., “My family and I” instead of “me and my family”).
  - Use conjunctions and proper punctuation to connect ideas clearly.

- **Prepositions & Plurals:**
  - Use correct prepositions (e.g., “in” a place, “as part of” a group).
  - Ensure plural nouns are correctly formed (e.g., “goals,” “months,” “things”).

- **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
  - Make sure the subject and verb agree in number and person.

## Vocabulary to Learn

To improve both everyday and business-like conversations, consider expanding your vocabulary with these words:

### Everyday Conversation

- **Actually, Really, Maybe, Perhaps:** Soften statements or express opinions.
- **Clearly, Definitely, Essentially:** Emphasize points in discussions.
- **Understand, Explain, Discuss:** Core verbs for daily interactions.

### Business & Professional Context

- **Enhance / Refine:** Use instead of “improve” (e.g., “enhance my skills”).
- **Objective / Aspiration:** Alternative to “goal” (e.g., “my objective is to…”).
- **Position / Employment:** In place of “work” (e.g., “seeking a new position”).
- **Manage / Handle:** Better alternatives to “deal with” (e.g., “I manage projects…”).
- **Strategy, Insight, Opportunity, Growth:** Common business-related terms.
- **Efficient, Resource, Investment, Network, Feedback:** Useful in professional settings.

Consider creating flashcards with these words and their alternatives to reinforce your learning and usage in both everyday and professional conversations.
