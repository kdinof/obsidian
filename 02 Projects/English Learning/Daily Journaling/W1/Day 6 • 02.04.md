# Task

**Day 6:** _Review & Cultural Notes._ 
- **Review:** Look back at Week 1’s material. Re-attempt any difficult listening segment (did the podcast clip sound clearer now?). Retry speaking about the Day 1 self-introduction – you should already do it with more ease. Go through your notebook of errors; quiz yourself if you’ve fixed them (for example, if you often wrote “he go”, make a conscious effort to say “he goes” now). 
- **Cultural Focus:** Since you’re targeting American English, spend some time on cultural immersion: read a brief article about an American cultural event or holiday, or watch a short documentary clip about an American city. This not only keeps things interesting but also teaches context/usage (and possibly idioms). 
- Discuss with your AI “tutor” about this topic – e.g. _“Explain Thanksgiving to me”_ or _“What are common phrases during baseball games?”_. This builds cultural literacy alongside language. 
- _Time:_ 20 min review activities, 20 min cultural reading/video, 10 min discussion with AI.

## Grammar Areas to Improve

Based on your weekly tasks and corrections, focus on the following key grammar areas:

- **Articles:**
  - Ensure consistent use of “a,” “an,” and “the” (e.g., “a temporary place,” “the birth of our second son”).

- **Verb Tenses & Forms:**
  - **Present Perfect:** Use “have/has + past participle” (e.g., “I have created” instead of “I wrote”).
  - **Gerunds:** Use gerunds after certain verbs (e.g., “enjoy working” rather than “enjoy work”).
  - **Verb Consistency:** Maintain consistent verb tenses within sentences and across related ideas.

- **Word Order & Sentence Structure:**
  - Arrange subjects for natural phrasing (e.g., “My family and I” instead of “me and my family”).
  - Use conjunctions and proper punctuation to connect ideas clearly.

- **Prepositions & Plurals:**
  - Use correct prepositions (e.g., “in” a place, “as part of” a group).
  - Ensure plural nouns are correctly formed (e.g., “goals,” “months,” “things”).

- **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
  - Make sure the subject and verb agree in number and person.

## Vocabulary to Learn

To improve both everyday and business-like conversations, consider expanding your vocabulary with these words:

### Everyday Conversation

- **Actually, Really, Maybe, Perhaps:** Soften statements or express opinions.
- **Clearly, Definitely, Essentially:** Emphasize points in discussions.
- **Understand, Explain, Discuss:** Core verbs for daily interactions.

### Business & Professional Context

- **Enhance / Refine:** Use instead of “improve” (e.g., “enhance my skills”).
- **Objective / Aspiration:** Alternative to “goal” (e.g., “my objective is to…”).
- **Position / Employment:** In place of “work” (e.g., “seeking a new position”).
- **Manage / Handle:** Better alternatives to “deal with” (e.g., “I manage projects…”).
- **Strategy, Insight, Opportunity, Growth:** Common business-related terms.
- **Efficient, Resource, Investment, Network, Feedback:** Useful in professional settings.

Consider creating flashcards with these words and their alternatives to reinforce your learning and usage in both everyday and professional conversations.
