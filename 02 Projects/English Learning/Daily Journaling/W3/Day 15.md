### **Day 15: Q&A Blitz and Fluency**
* **Speaking:**
    * Do a rapid-fire Q&A with the AI. Prompt it: "Ask me 20 random questions one by one, give me 30 seconds to answer each."
    * Respond quickly in English without overthinking, training your brain to formulate answers on the fly.
    * After the drill, ask the AI to highlight any major mistakes in your responses.
* **Pronunciation:**
    * Choose one difficult sound (e.g., American _r_ as in "world" or _v_ vs _w_ distinction) and spend 10 focused minutes on it.
    * Use minimal pair exercises (e.g., "rice vs lice" or "vine vs wine").
    * Ask the AI for a tongue-twister to practice.
* **Listening:**
    * Watch a short clip from a talk show or interview (Americans speaking naturally, maybe with some humor).
    * Note any idiomatic phrases you hear and ask the AI for clarification. Attempt to use one or two in a sentence yourself.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min Q&A speaking, 10 min error review, 10 min pronunciation, 15 min listening. 


## Pronunciation & Grammar Tips + 20 Advanced Words for Practice

Pronunciation Tips

Record Yourself – Practice speaking and record your voice. Compare it to native speakers (e.g., from YouTube or podcasts).

Shadowing Technique – Repeat immediately after hearing a native speaker. This helps with rhythm and intonation.

Focus on Problem Sounds – For many learners, these include "th" (/θ/ and /ð/), "r" vs. "l", and vowel sounds.

Stress & Intonation – English is a stress-timed language. Practice stressing content words and de-emphasizing function words.

Use Minimal Pairs – Practice words that differ by only one sound (e.g., ship/sheep, bat/bet).

Grammar Tips

Learn in Chunks – Instead of memorizing rules, learn phrases like "at the end of the day," "used to," etc.

Focus on Tenses with Time Markers – Practice the past perfect with "by the time," present perfect with "just/already/yet."

Modal Verbs – Practice must, might, should, could in real-life contexts: advice, possibility, permission, obligation.

Articles (a/an/the) – Use "the" when the listener knows what you're talking about; "a/an" when it's general.

Error Logs – Keep a log of your common grammar mistakes and correct examples for reference.
