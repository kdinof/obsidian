# Day 17: Presentation and Feedback

## Overview
Today focuses on developing your formal speaking skills by preparing and delivering a short presentation, recording and analyzing your performance, and using AI feedback to improve. You will also target specific pronunciation challenges identified during your presentation.

---

## Objectives
- Practice organizing and delivering a short presentation in English
- Record and analyze your spoken performance
- Use AI feedback to improve content and language
- Re-present with improvements
- Focus on pronunciation of challenging words

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Prepare Your Presentation
- **Choose a topic** you know well (e.g., a hobby, your job, a book you read).
- **Outline** your talk: Introduction, main points, conclusion (no need to script every word).
- **Aim for 2–3 minutes** of speaking time.

### 2. Deliver and Record
- **Present your talk** aloud, as naturally as possible.
- **Record yourself** (use your phone, computer, or any recording app).

### 3. Analyze and Get Feedback
- **Transcribe** your recording (manually or with a speech-to-text tool).
- **Submit the transcript or audio** to an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT) for feedback on:
  - Content organization
  - Grammar and vocabulary
  - Pronunciation (if using audio)
- **Review the feedback** and note specific suggestions for improvement.

### 4. Re-present with Improvements
- **Incorporate the feedback** into your presentation.
- **Deliver and record** your talk again, aiming to:
  - Use clearer structure
  - Correct previous mistakes
  - Add richer vocabulary or transition phrases
- **Compare** the two recordings to notice improvements.

### 5. Pronunciation Focus
- **Identify words or sounds** you struggled with during your presentation.
- **Practice these words** in isolation and in sentences.
- **Use AI or TTS tools** to model correct pronunciation and mimic them.

---

## Reflection
- What improvements did you notice between your first and second presentations?
- Which feedback was most helpful?
- Are there pronunciation patterns you still need to work on?

---

## Tips
- Don't worry about being perfect—focus on progress!
- Save both recordings to track your improvement over time.
- If possible, share your presentation with a friend or tutor for extra feedback.

# Notes

## 🗂️ Content Organisation

| What works well                                                 | Why it helps                                                         | Quick tweaks                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clear goal stated early** (“Today I’m going to talk about …”) | Sets audience expectations                                           | Turn that into a *one-sentence promise* that’s memorable: “You’ll walk away knowing exactly **how behavioural science can make your product as sticky as Instagram—without guilt-loops**.”                   |
| **Relatable contrast of two apps**                              | Stories > theory; everyone recognises the To-Do vs Instagram dilemma | Tighten the story arc:<br>1. *Hook* (the emotional paradox)<br>2. *Reveal* the hidden mechanism (zombie-mode brain)<br>3. *Apply* to product choices<br>4. *Call to action* (learn & use behavioural design) |
| **Personal voice**                                              | Builds rapport                                                       | Reserve the “I” anecdotes for one focused slide; elsewhere shift to “we” / “our teams” so the talk feels co-owned with the audience.                                                                         |

### Suggested 7-Slide Flow (≈ 5 min)

1. **The Paradox Hook** – To-Do vs Instagram screenshot, ask “Which *should* matter more?”
2. **Outcome Gap** – Value ≠ Usage (1 graph)
3. **Why?** – “Zombie-mode brain” (System 1 vs System 2 in one visual)
4. **3 Missed Opportunities** – Adoption, Retention, Monetisation
5. **Behavioural Design Toolkit** – 3 principles you’ll cover in a longer workshop
6. **Case Snapshot** – 1 min real product tweak → metric lift
7. **Invite** – “Bring emotions into your next sprint” + link/QR for resources

## ✍️ Grammar & Vocabulary

| Original                                                                  | Issue                       | Polished alternative                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “why a lot of companies are **not using** behavioral science”             | Wordy negative form         | “why many companies **ignore** behavioural science”                        |
| “what opportunities **they miss** without using behavioral design”        | Word order                  | “the opportunities **they miss out on** when they skip behavioural design” |
| “So, **one of them is a To-Do app and another one is an Instagram app.**” | Clunky repetition           | “We’ll compare a simple to-do app with Instagram.”                         |
| “**I think that 90 %** of these tasks are uncompleted.”                   | Verb + adjective            | “About 90 % of those tasks **remain unfinished**.”                         |
| “this product is **like opposite**”                                       | Missing article + adjective | “this product is **the exact opposite.**”                                  |
| “So, **yeah. So, this is the speech of my presentation.**”                | Filler, unclear             | “That wraps up the opening segment.”                                       |

**Words & phrases to level-up**

* **Utility vs. Hedonic value** (instead of “valuable / not valuable”)
* **Stickiness**, **cognitive load**, **negative reinforcement loop**
* Use **“because”** sparingly—swap some for *“since”, “as”, “given that”*.

### Cleaned-up mini-script (first minute)

> *“Good afternoon. Imagine two apps on your home screen: a to-do list that’s supposed to boost your productivity and Instagram, which—let’s be honest—rarely creates tangible value. Rationally, we *should* spend more time in the to-do app. Yet every morning I catch myself doom-scrolling while my tasks pile up unfinished. Why? Because Instagram is engineered to delight our emotional, automatic System 1, while most productivity tools address only our rational System 2. Today we’ll explore how behavioural design closes that gap.”*

## 🔊 Pronunciation & Delivery

| Observation (from transcript)                                                  | Likely cause                   | Practice tip                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequent filler **“So, …”**                                                    | Thinking out loud              | Pause → breathe → continue. Record a 30-sec clip *without* “so”.           |
| Repeating **“like”**                                                           | Habitual discourse marker      | Substitute with a silent beat or “for example”.                            |
| Word stress may fall on the wrong syllable (*“BE-havioral” vs “be-HA-vioral”*) | Russian native stress patterns | Drill key terms: **be-HA-viour-al**, **o-PPOR-tu-ni-ty**, **e-MO-tional**. |
| Potential monotone (can’t confirm without audio)                               | Focus on words, not melody     | Mark slides with 🔺/🔻 cues for rising & falling intonation.               |

> **Want precise feedback on sounds?** Record a 1-minute excerpt (phone mic is fine) and upload it; I’ll flag specific consonants/vowels and demo minimal-pair drills.

## Next Steps

1. **Choose** whether you want deeper slide-by-slide edits or a rewritten full script.
2. **Upload** a short audio sample if you’d like granular pronunciation notes.
3. **Iterate**: apply the flow above, then we’ll polish transitions and visuals.

Let me know which path you’d like to take, and we’ll keep pushing your English—and your story—toward an advanced, engaging delivery!


# Note 2 
Below is a **before ⇢ after** review that pinpoints what you improved in the second run-through and what to polish next. I follow the same three lenses we set earlier.

---

## 1 ▪ Content Organisation

|Aspect|What got better|Still to refine|
|---|---|---|
|**Framing / promise**|You added a clearer _“how we can use this knowledge in day-to-day work”_ statement, so the audience now knows _why_ to listen.|Turn it into a headline promise in Slide 1:_“Make your product as habit-forming as Instagram—without guilt loops.”_|
|**Example placement**|You jump straight into the Instagram vs To-Do contrast—good hook.|Give the audience a _question_ to engage them:_“Which app delivers more _true_ value?”_ Pause for a show-of-hands before you reveal the paradox.|
|**Logical bridge**|You now explicitly link the paradox to _System 1_ and design KPIs (adoption, retention, monetisation).|Add one slide that visualises the chain: **Emotion → Behaviour → Metric**. That makes the business impact concrete.|
|**Call-to-action**|You close with “I’ll share tactics & email you the deck.” Clear next step.|Preview _what_ tactics (“3 nudges you can test tomorrow”) so they look forward to specifics.|

---

## 2 ▪ Grammar & Vocabulary

Overall accuracy ↑ (fewer filler words and run-on sentences). Below are the standout fixes and a few items still tripping you up.

|Original line in v1|v2 revision|👍 Improvement|
|---|---|---|
|“why **a lot of companies are not using**”|“how **we can use** this knowledge”|Reframed positively and more concise|
|“I think that 90 %… are **uncompleted**”|“remain **unfinished**”|Better verb choice|
|Filler “you know”, “like”, “so yeah”|Drastically reduced|Smoother delivery|

**Remaining grammar tweaks**

|Current wording|Why it sounds off|Polished version|
|---|---|---|
|“compare **this to products** objectively”|Plural/singular mix|“compare **these two products** objectively”|
|“gives **less emotions**”|“Emotions” is count-uncount mismatch|“triggers **fewer positive emotions**”|
|“We definitely **tell** that To-Do list app gives more value”|Verb choice|“We can **agree** the To-Do app delivers more utility.”|
|“Instagram is **like a, I don't know, some time to procrastinating**”|Wordy/gerund|“Instagram is mostly **a procrastination tool**.”|
|“We are **like zombie**”|Article + plural|“We behave **like zombies**.”|
|“System 1 is **kind of automatic system**”|Double noun|“System 1 is **the automatic system in our brain**.”|

**Vocabulary to level-up next**

- utility vs hedonic value
    
- negative reinforcement loop
    
- cognitive ease
    
- intrinsic reward

## 3 ▪ Pronunciation & Delivery (inferred from text)

### What likely improved

- Fewer “so…, and…, you know…” fillers → pacing should feel more intentional.
    
- Shorter sentences → easier breathing & intonation control.
    

### Still watch for

|Likely issue|Self-check exercise|
|---|---|
|Stress on _behavioural_, _objective_, _adoption_|Record a 30-sec snippet; clap on the stressed syllable: _be-**HA**-viour-al, ob-**JEC**-tive, a-**DOP**-tion_.|
|Rising intonation on statements (common for Russian speakers)|End key statements with a falling tone. Mark ↓ at sentence ends in your notes.|
|Clustering consonants (_pro-c-ras-ti-na-ting_)|Slow-motion drill: split into syllables, then speed up.|

> **Next step if you want targeted sound notes:** upload a 45 – 60 sec audio sample; I’ll annotate exact phonemes and suggest minimal-pair drills.

---

## 🔜 Recommended Iteration Plan

1. **Rewrite Slide 1** with the upgraded promise + paradox question.
    
2. Add the **Emotion → Behaviour → Metric** bridge slide.
    
3. Touch up the grammar points above (quick 15-min edit).
    
4. Rehearse once aloud, recording yourself; listen for final filler words or stress slips.
    

Send either the updated slide text or a fresh recording, and I’ll give you the next-round fine-tuning. Great progress—keep the momentum and you’ll reach that advanced English feel (and a tighter story) quickly!---
