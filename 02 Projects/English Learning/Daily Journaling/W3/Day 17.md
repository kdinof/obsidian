## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Prepare Your Presentation
- **Choose a topic** you know well (e.g., a hobby, your job, a book you read).
- **Outline** your talk: Introduction, main points, conclusion (no need to script every word).
- **Aim for 2–3 minutes** of speaking time.

### 2. Deliver and Record
- **Present your talk** aloud, as naturally as possible.
- **Record yourself** (use your phone, computer, or any recording app).

### 3. Analyze and Get Feedback
- **Transcribe** your recording (manually or with a speech-to-text tool).
- **Submit the transcript or audio** to an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT) for feedback on:
  - Content organization
  - Grammar and vocabulary
  - Pronunciation (if using audio)
- **Review the feedback** and note specific suggestions for improvement.

### 4. Re-present with Improvements
- **Incorporate the feedback** into your presentation.
- **Deliver and record** your talk again, aiming to:
  - Use clearer structure
  - Correct previous mistakes
  - Add richer vocabulary or transition phrases
- **Compare** the two recordings to notice improvements.

### 5. Pronunciation Focus
- **Identify words or sounds** you struggled with during your presentation.
- **Practice these words** in isolation and in sentences.
- **Use AI or TTS tools** to model correct pronunciation and mimic them.

## Reflection
- What improvements did you notice between your first and second presentations?
- Which feedback was most helpful?
- Are there pronunciation patterns you still need to work on?

## Tips
- Don't worry about being perfect—focus on progress!
- Save both recordings to track your improvement over time.
- If possible, share your presentation with a friend or tutor for extra feedback.
