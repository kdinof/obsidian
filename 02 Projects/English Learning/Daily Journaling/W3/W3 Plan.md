# English Lesson Plan: Week 3

### **Day 15: Q&A Blitz and Fluency**
* **Speaking:**
    * Do a rapid-fire Q&A with the AI. Prompt it: "Ask me 20 random questions one by one, give me 30 seconds to answer each."
    * Respond quickly in English without overthinking, training your brain to formulate answers on the fly.
    * After the drill, ask the AI to highlight any major mistakes in your responses.
* **Pronunciation:**
    * Choose one difficult sound (e.g., American _r_ as in "world" or _v_ vs _w_ distinction) and spend 10 focused minutes on it.
    * Use minimal pair exercises (e.g., "rice vs lice" or "vine vs wine").
    * Ask the AI for a tongue-twister to practice.
* **Listening:**
    * Watch a short clip from a talk show or interview (Americans speaking naturally, maybe with some humor).
    * Note any idiomatic phrases you hear and ask the AI for clarification. Attempt to use one or two in a sentence yourself.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min Q&A speaking, 10 min error review, 10 min pronunciation, 15 min listening.

### **Day 16: Role-Play and Idioms**
* **Speaking (Role-Play):**
    * Tell the AI you want to role-play a phone call or meeting (e.g., making an appointment, deciding who will lead a project).
    * Practice the dialogue, focusing on sounding polite and natural.
    * After the role-play, ask the AI for alternative phrases or idiomatic ways to say something.
* **Vocabulary/Idioms:**
    * Take 5 common American idioms or slang terms (ask the AI for a list) and find ways to naturally incorporate them in sentences or mini-stories.
    * Use the AI to verify if you used them correctly.
* **Listening/Speaking:**
    * Listen to a 5-min segment of an American podcast at 1.25x speed.
    * Immediately after, try to paraphrase what was said, either to the AI or in writing.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min role-play, 15 min idiom practice, 20 min podcast and paraphrase.

### **Day 17: Presentation and Feedback**
* **Speaking:**
    * Prepare a short presentation (2–3 minutes) on a topic of your choice.
    * Jot down bullet points but don't script it fully – practice delivering it naturally.
    * Record yourself giving this talk.
    * Play it for an AI that can analyze audio or transcribe it and feed the text to the AI for analysis.
    * Ask for feedback on both content and language.
* **Error Correction:**
    * Take the feedback and do a second attempt, incorporating improvements.
    * Compare the recordings if possible.
* **Pronunciation:**
    * Identify any words you stumbled on during the presentation and practice them specifically.
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min preparing and recording talk, 15 min AI feedback, 15 min re-presentation.

### **Day 18: Interactive Listening & Speaking**
* **Listening:**
    * Join a live interactive English event online, if available (Clubhouse, Twitter Space, livestream, etc.).
    * If not possible, simulate it: pick a talk or lecture and imagine you could ask the speaker questions.
* **Speaking:**
    * Formulate 2–3 questions in English that you would ask about the talk's content.
    * Ask your AI those questions and have it answer as if it's the speaker.
* **Conversation Practice:**
    * Have a free-form conversation with the AI for at least 15 minutes on any topic that arises.
    * Focus on using some of this week's new idioms or vocabulary in your replies.
* **Vocabulary:**
    * Add any new words from today's talk or conversation to your flashcards.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min listening event, 15 min Q&A creation, 15+ min AI conversation, 10 min vocab.

### **Day 19: Accent and Pronunciation Day**
* **Shadowing Advanced:**
    * Take a challenging audio (e.g., a scene from a fast-paced TV show or a clip with a strong American regional accent) and try to shadow small chunks, imitating not just words but rhythm and emotion.
* **Pronunciation Drills:**
    * Use an AI pronunciation tool or app to get scores on particular sounds or sentences.
    * Spend 15–20 minutes on such an app for targeted training.
* **Reading Aloud:**
    * Take a paragraph from a news article and read it aloud as if you were a newscaster, focusing on clarity and American pronunciation.
    * Compare with the actual newscaster if possible.
* **Feedback:**
    * Mark improvements by recording yourself at the start and end of Day 19 to hear the difference.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min shadowing, 20 min pronunciation app/drills, 10 min reading aloud practice.

### **Day 20: Integrated Skills Project – "Teach Back"**
* **Project:**
    * Choose a topic you learned recently and prepare to "teach" it in English as if to an audience.
    * Explain it in a structured way (introduction, key points, conclusion).
    * Do it in front of a mirror or record it.
* **Interaction:**
    * After your explanation, have the AI ask you 2 follow-up questions (acting like a student). Answer those questions verbally.
* **Listening:**
    * As a reward, watch something entertaining in English (half an hour of an American series or YouTube vlog) without focusing on study – just enjoy and notice how much more you understand now than a month ago.
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min preparing & teaching, 10 min Q&A, 30 min fun listening.

### **Day 21: Week 3 Recap & Self-Evaluation**
* **Fluency Check:**
    * On Day 15 you did quick Q&As – do a similar exercise now (have the AI ask random new questions) and see if you answer more fluidly or with richer language.
* **Pronunciation Check:**
    * Replay an audio of yourself from Week 1 or 2 and one from this week – appreciate improvements in clarity or confidence.
    * Ask a fresh set of pronunciation sentences from the AI to test and record yourself.
* **Plan Ahead:**
    * Identify any gaps from this week. Did you encounter words you couldn't pronounce or questions you couldn't answer? Note them.
    * Think about what you want to focus on next: Week 4 will involve more writing, so gather ideas (maybe you want to work on formal writing or storytelling).
* **Light Practice:**
    * Do a short review of all Week 3 idioms and phrases learned (maybe make a silly story that uses all of them) to ensure they stick.
    * Then relax – watch something or do a non-language hobby to recharge.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min Q&A and checks, 10 min review notes, 20 min idiom recap.
