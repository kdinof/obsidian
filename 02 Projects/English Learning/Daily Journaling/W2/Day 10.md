**Day 10:** 
- _Dialogue Practice and Pronunciation._ 
- **Speaking/Listening:** Use an American TV show or movie scene script for a **dialogue practice**. Find a short scene script (or subtitles). Play the scene’s audio and try to _speak along_ with one of the characters (shadowing in a conversational context). Alternatively, mute and _dub the scene yourself_: you speak one character’s lines and let the audio play the other, trying to match timing and emotion. This is a fun way to improve intonation and rhythm in dialogue. 
- **AI Role-play:** Next, have a conversational role-play with the AI on a specific scenario: e.g., _“Pretend we are coworkers planning a project – let’s discuss our ideas.”_ This brings more technical/business vocabulary. 
- **Pronunciation focus:** Work on **word stress and intonation** today. Take 5 multi-syllable new words from your vocab list and use TTS to hear them, then record yourself pronouncing them. Check with AI if you’re placing the stress correctly (you can type, “Is it pronounced PROject or proJECT in this context?”). _Time:_ 20 min dialogue practice, 15 min AI role-play, 15 min pronunciation.
