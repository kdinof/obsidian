# Day 8: News Dive and Summary

* **Listening/Reading:**
	* Choose a longer news article or podcast (approx. 10 minutes audio), like NPR’s “Up First” or a TED Talk by an American speaker.
    * Read a summary or headline first for context.
    * Listen to the full audio *without* the transcript, aiming to grasp the main points.
    * After listening, read the transcript or article to understand details you missed.
* **Speaking:**
    * Summarize the content in your own words.
    * Record yourself or explain it verbally to an AI for feedback and correction.
* **Vocabulary:**
    * Identify and write down at least 5 new words or phrases from the news item.
    * Ask an AI for synonyms, antonyms, or example sentences for these words in an American English context.
* **Pronunciation Focus:**
    * Practice the *“th” sound* (e.g., thin, then, thought).
    * Read sentences containing "th" aloud into a voice-to-text tool.
    * If the tool struggles, ask an AI for tips on tongue placement and practice again.
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min (Listening + Transcript), 15 min (Speaking Summary), 15 min (Vocabulary + Pronunciation).

In corporate strategy projects, executive leadership teams work through a series of questions to determine how their businesses can succeed. Individuals can use a similar process to figure out how to live a meaningful life. It starts with defining what makes a great life for you and then outlining your purpose and vision. You must also look at your current “portfolio” — the areas in which you spend your time and energy — to see if you’re investing the best of yourself in the activities most important to you. You should consider what research says about how people tend to find meaning and joy in life. Finally, you’ll want to identify areas where you need to make changes, and then ensure you follow through with objectives and key results. This program, Strategize Your Life, has been tested with more than 500 people around the world. With a few hours of work, you can develop a personal life strategy and summarize it on a single page.

## Record
So this video was about the purpose of life and how to choose this purpose and also how to focus on things that leads to your life goals and focus on things that you really enjoy.  So the speaker tell that you could use some business thinking to life thinking.  So how you the approaches on how you operate your business can be like translated.  And can be used on how you can operate your life.  And there was about six or seven questions about understanding your life goals, your focuses.  And I think and I remember that the speaker covered like three of them.  And one is the first one is how I define a great life.  And there was a framework it called P-E-R-M-A-V like a perma-uv.  And it's all about like quality or like some characteristic of your life.  So you have to like understand this characteristic.  The second question was about portfolio.  So how do I assess my portfolio?  So portfolio here means like life areas.  So how do I assess my life areas.  So how I can evaluate my life areas.  And the speaker provides like three steps approach.  So on the first step you have to evaluate your life units.  So it's about 16 life units.  So it's about 16 life units.  And you have to evaluate each of these life units.  And then you have to evaluate it again.  So I don't remember.  So at the final you have a like a two by two metrics where you like place your life units.  So each life units.  So each life units.  Each of life units has importance score and pleasure score.  And you have to like point this life units on this metrics.  And you see that some of life points will be on the quadrant that maybe have a high impact or high value.  But it's but this life unit is not enjoyable.  So yeah interesting fact that it like important for you.  But you don't like to do this.  And you have to like understand what you have to do with it.  Or another interesting like a quadrant of this metrics is low value.  So life units that gives you low value.  But you spend on this life units a lot of time.  So for more participants who participated in this test.  It was a social media.  So social media is not it's not really important thing.  But a lot of people spend too much time on this.  And the third like step on this like life evaluation and goal setting process was what portfolio choices.  So we have to choose what to focus on.  So and here I think I don't remember but I but here I think that author tells that you have to go and read for article.  But you can correct me.  So I think this is a really helpful article.  And I think that I will use this approach.  And this method to like just to try.  Evaluate like my life.

## Result
Okay, I can help with that. I've reviewed the summary of the YouTube video (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s`) and compared it with the transcription of your recording. I've also checked your grammar.

Here's the breakdown:

### Video Content Comparison: Your Recording vs. Video Summary

You did a good job capturing the core concepts of the video! Here's a comparison:

**What You Covered Well:**

- **Main Idea:** You correctly understood the central theme: applying strategic business thinking to personal life to define goals, focus, and find enjoyment [[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=0), [01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=69)].
- **PERMA-V Framework:** You remembered the PERMA-V model mentioned for defining a "great life" and linked it to life characteristics [[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=194)].
- **Life Portfolio/Units Assessment:** You accurately recalled the process of assessing life areas (which the video calls "strategic life units" [[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=277)]). You mentioned evaluating them, using the 2x2 "Strategic Life Portfolio" matrix [[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=375)], and plotting units based on importance and satisfaction (you used "pleasure score," which is very close) [[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=375)].
- **Identifying Key Quadrants:** You correctly identified important insights from the matrix, such as units that are important but not enjoyable, and units that are low value but consume a lot of time (like social media for many) [[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=398), [07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=461)].
- **Portfolio Choices:** You remembered the step about making choices regarding your life portfolio [[02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=129)].

**Potential Gaps or Misunderstandings:**

- **Seven Steps:** The video outlines a specific seven-step program [[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=90)]. You mentioned remembering 6 or 7 questions but focused mainly on three aspects (defining a great life, assessing the portfolio, making choices). The other steps mentioned in the summary are: identifying life purpose, defining life vision, learning from best practices, and ensuring sustained change.
- **Number of Life Units:** You mentioned "16 life units" twice. While the video discusses evaluating different life units [[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=277)], the summary provided doesn't specify the number 16. It refers to them more generally.
- **Assessment Flow:** Your description of evaluating the units was generally right but slightly mixed up compared to the summary's flow (Define units -> Assess time/importance/satisfaction -> Plot on matrix [00:04:37 - 00:06:15]).
- **Portfolio Choices Detail:** You recalled the need to make choices but weren't sure about the details, guessing it involved reading an article. The summary states this step involves adjusting your life units to align with your definition of a great life, purpose, and vision [[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbiNhAZlXZk&t=1s&t=461)].

### Grammar Feedback on Your Recording Transcription

You expressed your thoughts clearly overall! Here are a few suggestions to make your English sound even more natural:

- **Verb Tense:** "So the speaker **tell** that..." should be "So the speaker **tells** that..." (present tense) or "So the speaker **said** that..." (past tense).
- **Plurals:**
    - "...six or seven **question**..." should be "...six or seven **questions**..."
    - "...some **characteristic**..." should be "...some **characteristics**..."
    - "...this **characteristic**." should be "...these **characteristics**."
    - "...life **units** that **gives**..." should be "...life **units** that **give**..." (plural subject "units" needs plural verb "give").
- **Articles (a, an, the):**
    - "...framework **it called**..." should be "...framework **called**..."
    - "...provides **like** three **steps** approach." should be "...provides **a** three-**step** approach."
    - "...**a** two by two **metrics**..." should be "...**a** two-by-two **matrix**..." ("Matrix" is singular).
    - "...**importance** score and **pleasure** score." should be "...**an** importance score and **a** pleasure score."
    - "...not really important **thing**." should be "...not **a** really important thing."
    - "...read **for** article." should be "...read **an** article."
- **Word Choice/Phrasing:**
    - "...how you the approaches on how you operate..." could be rephrased as "...the **approaches to** how you operate..." or "...how the approaches you use to operate..."
    - "And **can be used on** how you can operate..." is a bit redundant. Better: "And **can be applied to** how you operate your life."
    - "So **at the final** you have..." should be "**Finally**, you have..." or "**In the end**, you have..."
    - "...point **this** life units on **this** metrics." should be "...plot **these** life units on **this matrix**."
    - "...**it like** important for you." should be "...it **is** important for you."
    - "...don't like **to do this**." is okay, but "...don't like **doing it**." sounds slightly more natural here.
    - "But you spend **on this** life units a lot of time." should be "But you spend a lot of time **on these** life units."
    - "So **for more** participants..." - Did you mean "**For most** participants..."?
    - "**It was a** social media." should be "**It** was social media." or "**This** was social media."
    - "...was **what** portfolio choices." should be "...was **making** portfolio choices." or "...was **about** portfolio choices."
- **Filler Words:** You used "like" quite often (e.g., "can be like translated", "like quality", "like a perma-uv", "provides like three steps"). Try to reduce its use for more formal or clear speech.

Overall, you demonstrated a strong understanding of the video's main points. Focusing on the specific seven steps and refining some grammar points like verb tenses, plurals, and articles will further improve your comprehension and spoken English. Keep up the great practice!
