# English Lesson Plan: Week 2

### **Day 8: News Dive and Summary**

* **Listening/Reading:**
    * Choose a longer news article or podcast (approx. 10 minutes audio), like NPR’s “Up First” or a TED Talk by an American speaker.
    * Read a summary or headline first for context.
    * Listen to the full audio *without* the transcript, aiming to grasp the main points.
    * After listening, read the transcript or article to understand details you missed.
* **Speaking:**
    * Summarize the content in your own words.
    * Record yourself or explain it verbally to an AI for feedback and correction.
* **Vocabulary:**
    * Identify and write down at least 5 new words or phrases from the news item.
    * Ask an AI for synonyms, antonyms, or example sentences for these words in an American English context.
* **Pronunciation Focus:**
    * Practice the *“th” sound* (e.g., thin, then, thought).
    * Read sentences containing "th" aloud into a voice-to-text tool.
    * If the tool struggles, ask an AI for tips on tongue placement and practice again.
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min (Listening + Transcript), 15 min (Speaking Summary), 15 min (Vocabulary + Pronunciation).

### **Day 9: Intensive Reading & Questioning**

* **Reading:**
    * Select an interesting article (around 1000 words), such as a Wikipedia entry or a story from an American magazine.
    * Read actively: pause after each paragraph to jot down a note or formulate a question about it.
    * Formulate **questions in English** about the content and ask an AI to check your understanding (e.g., “According to this article, why did X happen?”).
* **Speaking:**
    * Engage in 5 minutes of **fast-paced reflex speaking**.
    * Use an online topic generator or ask an AI for a random topic.
    * Speak nonstop about the topic for 2 minutes. Repeat with a second topic. Focus on fluency over perfection.
* **Feedback:**
    * Optionally, transcribe your 2-minute monologues and review for major errors, or ask an AI to highlight grammar slips.
* **Spaced Repetition:**
    * Review vocabulary flashcards from Weeks 1–2 (~60 words).
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min (Reading), 10 min (Q&A with AI), 15 min (Speaking Drill), 15 min (Flashcard Review).

### **Day 10: Dialogue Practice and Pronunciation**

* **Speaking/Listening (Dialogue Practice):**
    * Find a short script or subtitles from an American TV show or movie scene.
    * Play the scene's audio and *speak along* with one character (shadowing).
    * Alternatively, mute the audio and *dub the scene yourself*, speaking one character's lines while letting the audio play the other parts, matching timing and emotion.
* **AI Role-play:**
    * Engage in a conversational role-play with an AI based on a specific scenario (e.g., _“Pretend we are coworkers planning a project – let’s discuss our ideas.”_). This helps practice specific vocabulary (like business terms).
* **Pronunciation Focus:**
    * Work on **word stress and intonation**.
    * Select 5 multi-syllable words from your vocabulary list.
    * Use a Text-to-Speech (TTS) tool to hear the correct pronunciation.
    * Record yourself saying the words and ask an AI to verify if you're placing the stress correctly (e.g., "Is it pronounced PROject or proJECT in this context?").
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min (Dialogue Practice), 15 min (AI Role-play), 15 min (Pronunciation).

### **Day 11: Grammar Clinic & Writing**

* **Grammar:**
    * Choose a specific grammar point you find challenging (e.g., conditionals, present perfect vs. simple past) based on your tracked errors.
    * Study it using a short YouTube lesson or a clear online explanation.
    * **Teach the rule back to an AI** in your own words, providing examples. The AI can offer corrections or additions.
* **Writing:**
    * Write a short narrative or anecdote (approx. 200 words) that requires you to use the grammar structure you just studied (e.g., a story using many "if...then" conditional clauses).
    * Ask an AI for feedback, specifically focusing on the target grammar point.
* **Listening:**
    * Listen to an American song and try to transcribe the lyrics by ear (dictation).
    * Compare your transcription with the actual lyrics to check your understanding of connected speech.
* _Time Allocation:_ 20 min (Grammar Study), 20 min (Writing), 20 min (Music Dictation).

### **Day 12: Immersion Day**

* **Goal:** Simulate an *"English-only" day*. Set your devices (phone, computer) to English.
* **Speaking:**
    * Narrate your daily actions and thoughts aloud in English (e.g., “I am making coffee now. I need to prepare for my meeting at 10.”).
* **AI Buddy Interaction:**
    * Use a voice assistant or AI tool for at least 5 interactions throughout the day (e.g., ask for the weather, set reminders, tell it a joke) in English. Treat it like a conversational partner.
* **Media Consumption:**
    * Maximize your exposure to American English media: listen to podcasts during commutes or walks, read English social media posts, watch an American TV series or movie in the evening. Focus on *soaking in the language* rather than intensive study.
* **Reflection:**
    * At the end of the day, write a brief journal entry (in English) about the experience. Ask an AI to correct it.
* _Time Allocation:_ Integrated throughout the day (aim for 2+ hours of English exposure, spread out).

### **Day 13: Review and Progress Check**

* **Review Goals:**
    * Revisit your Week 2 goals. Did you learn the target number of new words (e.g., 40)? Test yourself or have an AI quiz you.
    * Assess listening comprehension improvement. Try re-listening to the Day 8 news item – can you understand more now?
* **Speaking Check:**
    * Record a new 2-minute talk (e.g., redo your Day 1 self-introduction or talk about "My Week 2 experiences").
    * Compare this recording to your Week 1 recording. Note improvements in fluency, pronunciation, or grammar. Identify persistent issues to focus on in Week 3.
* **Light Practice:**
    * Engage in an enjoyable English activity: play an online word game (Wordle, crossword), or have a casual chat with an AI about a hobby.
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min (Review/Tests), 15 min (Speaking Sample), 15 min (Fun Activity).

### **Day 14: Rest or Catch-up**

* **Purpose:** Relax and consolidate learning.
* **Options:**
    * **Catch-up:** Complete any missed activities from the week.
    * **Relaxed Exposure:** Watch an American movie (using subtitles is acceptable).
    * **Creative Writing:** Write song lyrics, a poem, or a short story in English and get AI feedback.
    * **Review:** Spend 10 minutes reviewing flashcards.
    * **Rest:** Take the day off from active study to allow your brain to process the information.

## **End of Week 2 Check: Expected Results**

By the end of this week, you should aim to see noticeable progress in several areas:

* **Listening Comprehension:** You might find it easier to understand slower-paced news reports or discussions.
* **Active Vocabulary:** Your vocabulary should have expanded. You may start recognizing or even using some of the new words and phrases you've learned.
* **Speaking Comfort:** You should feel more comfortable speaking, whether it's narrating your thoughts, interacting with an AI, or recording yourself.
* **Error Awareness:** You will likely have identified specific, recurring errors (in pronunciation or grammar) that you can target for improvement in the following weeks.

This week lays a stronger foundation, preparing you for more output-focused practice moving forward.
