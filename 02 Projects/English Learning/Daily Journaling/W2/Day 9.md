### **Day 9: Intensive Reading & Questioning**

* **Reading:**
    * Select an interesting article (around 1000 words), such as a Wikipedia entry or a story from an American magazine.
    * Read actively: pause after each paragraph to jot down a note or formulate a question about it.
    * Formulate **questions in English** about the content and ask an AI to check your understanding (e.g., “According to this article, why did X happen?”).
* **Speaking:**
    * Engage in 5 minutes of **fast-paced reflex speaking**.
    * Use an online topic generator or ask an AI for a random topic.
    * Speak nonstop about the topic for 2 minutes. Repeat with a second topic. Focus on fluency over perfection.
* **Feedback:**
    * Optionally, transcribe your 2-minute monologues and review for major errors, or ask an AI to highlight grammar slips.
* **Spaced Repetition:**
    * Review vocabulary flashcards from Weeks 1–2 (~60 words).
* _Time Allocation:_ 30 min (Reading), 10 min (Q&A with AI), 15 min (Speaking Drill), 15 min (Flashcard Review).

### 📘 **Grammar Points to Focus On**

✔️ Verb Tense Consistency
Make sure to keep the same tense when describing related actions.  
✅ "I will show how this works and explain the logic behind it."  
❌ "I will show how this works and explained the logic."

✔️ Article Usage (a / an / the)
Use a/an for something non-specific, and the for something specific or already mentioned.  
✅ "There will be a rise in user-generated tools."  
✅ "We’ll look at the impact on design teams."

✔️ Prepositions
Common ones to watch: in, on, for, to, with.  
✅ "Focus on the user’s behavior."  
✅ "This leads to faster iterations."

✔️ Subject-Verb Agreement
Make sure singular subjects go with singular verbs, and plural with plural.  
✅ "This helps teams."  
✅ "AI tools enable users."
