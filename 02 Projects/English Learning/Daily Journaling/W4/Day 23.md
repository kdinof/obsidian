# Week 4, Day 23: Deep Reading and Discussion

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 23:** _Deep Reading and Discussion._ **Reading:** Begin reading a longer text (something you can continue through the week – e.g. an English short story, or several news feature articles on a theme). Aim to read for at least 30 minutes continuously. While reading, try not to look up every unknown word; underline them and see if you can guess from context first. After finishing the segment, choose a few of those unknown words and infer meaning, then confirm with a dictionary or AI. **Discussion:** Talk about what you read. If it's a story, describe the plot to the AI and give your reaction. If it's an article, discuss the issue – perhaps have the AI debate you ("I will take the opposite stance, let's debate"). This ensures you've processed the content deeply. **Vocabulary:** From today's reading, select 5–10 advanced words or expressions. Add them to your flashcards or list. Use each in a sentence (written or spoken) to solidify understanding. **Grammar focus:** Pay attention to any complex sentence structures in the text (long sentences with multiple clauses, for example). Take one long sentence you found and break it down with the AI's help to ensure you understand how it's constructed. _Time:_ 30–40 min reading, 15 min discussion/debate, 15 min vocab and grammar analysis.
