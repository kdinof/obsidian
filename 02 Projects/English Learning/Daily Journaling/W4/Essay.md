### Why modern technologies make us more isolated.

The first modern-like phone was invented in 1876 it only 150 years ago. This invention had started the era when we can instantly communicate being faraway from each other. Since than technologies did a huge step forward. Now we can not only hear someone, but see in real time and some times see in 3d. It can feels like we never will be alone, but the tendency and statistics show opposite. 

Let's see how technologies are changing how we communicate starting from 1876 when the first modern like phone was invented. Phones was rare interior item. But it gave for us ability to hear each other. Phones became more and more affordable and after 50-60 years it became not rare part of an interior. But steel, if you want to see someone, you have to go and meet them. 

In 1990 internet era started and after 10 years it became pervasive part of daily live.  Now we instant messaging, making a voice and a video calls. Moreover our personal informations became more disseminated because of social media. We are constantly posting information about us, and now everybody can know what we did, eat and where we were. 

But human brain haven't adapted yet. It still the brain that humans have 1000 years ago, with the same instincts, fears and needs. And we steel need to connect with each other in person. Some times it hard to tell something in person and we prefer to use online communication but sometimes it better and it gives us a lot of joy, energy and fulfillment.

I personally treat online communication as a tool that help me with my goals but not as a only one way to communicate with other people.
