# Week 4, Day 27: Comprehensive Review and Free Conversation

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 27:** _Comprehensive Review and Free Conversation._ **Review:** Mid-way through Month 2, take this day to consolidate. Review your writings from earlier weeks – do you notice progress in complexity and accuracy? Perhaps run one of your older texts through the AI again and see if it finds fewer errors now. **Grammar/Vocab Review:** Pick up your error log and flashcard deck and study areas that still trouble you (maybe do a quiz with the AI: "Test me on 10 hard words from my list" or "Give me 5 sentences to translate/fix that cover my common mistakes"). **Free Conversation:** Have a completely unstructured, relaxed conversation with the AI or an English-speaking friend for at least 20 minutes. Treat it as chatting over coffee. This is to enjoy your ability to converse without a "lesson" feel – you might talk about your plans, something in the news, a movie you watched. Try to notice that you can keep a conversation going much longer now than you could initially. **Optional Fun:** If you have the capacity, try playing an interactive text-based game or adventure in English (some AI can simulate games, or use a language learning game app) – this indirectly reinforces reading and quick thinking in English. _Time:_ 20 min review, 20 min flashcard/error quiz, 20+ min conversation/gaming.
