# Week 4, Day 22: Essay Writing (Draft 1)

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 22:** _Essay Writing (Draft 1)._ 
- **Writing:** Choose a prompt for an essay or opinion piece. For example, “Do you agree or disagree that social media has improved communication?” or any topic you feel strongly about (you can get a prompt from IELTS/TOEFL writing pools or ask the AI for one). Write a 300-word essay expressing your opinion, with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Don't worry about perfection on the first draft; just focus on organizing your ideas in English. 
- **Revision:** Run this essay through an AI writing assistant. Have it point out grammar issues, unclear phrases, or suggest more native-like wording. Study the suggestions – this is where you'll learn nuances (perhaps replacing "very big" with "huge" or fixing a tense inconsistency). 
- **Rewrite:** Produce a second draft incorporating the feedback. Compare the two versions to see improvements. (If the AI is capable, ask it to "grade" or give a level for your essay – just for motivation). 
- **Speaking:** Summarize your essay's stance in a short speech to the AI or a friend (e.g. "In my essay, I argued that... because..."). This reinforces the language used in writing. _Time:_ 40 min writing and editing, 10 min reviewing changes, 10 min spoken summary.
