# Week 4, Day 24: Formal Email or Letter and Idiomatic Contrast

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 24:** _Formal Email or Letter and Idiomatic Contrast._ **Writing:** Practice a different register â€“ writing a formal email or letter. Scenario: imagine you need to write to a company to complain about a product, or write a cover letter for a job application. Write ~200 words in a formal tone (use polite expressions, full sentences, correct salutations like "Dear Sir or Madam," and closing "Sincerely," etc.). Use AI to proofread and ensure your tone is appropriately formal (e.g. not using contractions if not suitable, etc.). **Idiom/Slang Contrast:** Then, as a contrast exercise, rewrite the main content of that letter in a very **informal or slangy** way (as if telling a friend the same content). This is mostly for fun and awareness of register differences. The AI can help turn your formal writing into casual speech. Compare the two versions, noting how vocabulary and structure differ. **Speaking:** Read your formal letter aloud, practicing a clear and professional tone (this can indirectly help pronunciation and intonation in formal settings). **Listening:** Find a short video or podcast on professional communication or language tips (e.g. a YouTube video on "common mistakes in business emails"). This may give you extra pointers. _Time:_ 25 min writing and editing, 10 min informal rewrite, 10 min aloud reading, 15 min listening.
