# Week 4, Day 28: Rest & Reflection

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 28:** _Rest & Reflection._ Take a break from intensive study. Lightly review any remaining flashcards or maybe watch an English film as leisure. Reflect on your journey: you're two-thirds through the plan. Perhaps write a short entry (in English) about how you feel regarding your progress, what you enjoy or find challenging about self-study, and what you want to focus on in the final month. This reflection itself is good writing practice, and it's motivational to see how far you've come. You can share this reflection with the AI and see if it has any advice or encouragement for the last month.
