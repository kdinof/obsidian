# Week 4, Day 26: Research and Presentation

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 26:** _Research and Presentation._ **Integrated Task:** Choose a topic and do a mini "research project". For example, pick an American historical figure or a place you'd like to visit. Spend ~20 minutes reading about it from at least two sources (Wikipedia, travel blog, etc.). Then **write a brief report** (or outline) on what you learned, as if you were preparing notes for a presentation or article (maybe 200 words outline/bullets). **Speaking (Presentation):** Present the information in a structured way to the AI or a friend as if you're teaching them. Use a few visuals if possible (even if just imagining them). Focus on clear delivery and proper nouns pronunciation (American places/names can be tricky â€“ verify with TTS how to say them). **Q&A:** Have the AI or your friend ask a couple of questions about the topic that you didn't cover, so you practice thinking and responding (if you don't know the answer, practice how to say that too, like "I'm not sure, but I believe..."). This mimics a real presentation scenario. _Time:_ 20 min research, 15 min writing notes, 15 min speaking presentation, 10 min Q&A.
