# Week 4, Day 25: Creative Writing and Storytelling

*This plan is from the "Week 6: Writing Focus and Complex Structures" section of your English Learning Plan.*

- **Day 25:** _Creative Writing and Storytelling._ **Writing:** Try your hand at a short creative piece – for instance, a 250-word short story or a personal anecdote written in a narrative style. Focus on using descriptive language (adjectives, sensory details) and perhaps some advanced tenses (like past perfect, or conditional forms if your story has hypothetical elements). **Feedback:** Have the AI review it for narrative clarity and language. Specifically ask it to highlight any awkward phrasing. Learn at least two new expressions from its feedback for describing events or feelings. **Storytelling (Speaking):** Now orally _tell_ a story – it could be the same story or a different one. Use expressive intonation. If possible, record and see if you can convey the excitement or emotion. The AI can even judge your storytelling (you can ask, "Did that story make sense? How was my vocabulary?"). **Pronunciation/Fluency:** Today, focus on _intonation_ – when telling the story, exaggerate the rise and fall of your voice; this makes you more comprehensible and engaging. _Time:_ 30 min writing, 15 min editing, 15 min oral storytelling.
