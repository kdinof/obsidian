There are six big categories of how people spend time. Each category is called a strategic life area, or S L A, and each one is subdivided into smaller activities, called strategic life units. The Relationships S L A, is divided into significant other, family, and friends. The Body, Mind, and Spirituality S L A, is divided into physical health and sports, mental health and mindfulness, and spirituality and faith. The Community and Society S L A, is divided into community and citizenship, and societal engagement. The Job, Learning, and Finances S L A, is divided into job and career, education and learning, and finances. The Interests and Entertainment S L A, is divided into hobbies and interests, online entertainment, and off-line entertainment. And the Personal Care S L A, is divided into physiological needs, and activities of daily living.

The exhibit shows how someone could analyze how they are spending their time on a weekly basis. It plots someone’s life activities on a 2 by 2 matrix, with the satisfaction provided by the activity on the x-axis, and the importance of the activity on the y-axis. When an activity is plotted, the size of its bubble corresponds to how much time someone spends on it in a given week. In the example, the person assigns the most importance and satisfaction to activities including family, friendship, physical health and sports, physiological needs, and finances. The 2 by 2 matrix also shows which activities someone should spend less time on, since they have higher time investment but relatively lower importance. For this person, online entertainment is an activity they could spend less time on.

The findings show that people report feeling greater life satisfaction, for example, when they are married, when they’re physically active more often, when they’re more socially engaged, and when they get seven to ten hours of sleep per night.

Individuals can use a similar process to figure out how to live a meaningful life. It starts with defining what makes a great life for you and then outlining your purpose and vision. You must also look at your current “portfolio” — the areas in which you spend your time and energy — to see if you’re investing the best of yourself in the activities most important to you. You should consider what research says about how people tend to find meaning and joy in life. Finally, you’ll want to identify areas where you need to make changes, and then ensure you follow through with objectives and key results. This program, Strategize Your Life, has been tested with more than 500 people around the world. With a few hours of work, you can develop a personal life strategy and summarize it on a single page.","tags":["clippings"]},"blocks":{"#---frontmatter---":[1,11],"#":[12,13],"##Summary.":[14,26],"##Summary.#{1}":[16,17],"##Summary.#{2}":[18,18],"##Summary.#{3}":[19,20],"##Summary.#{4}":[21,26],"##A Surprising Symmetry":[27,66],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{1}":[29,30],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{2}":[31,31],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{3}":[32,32],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{4}":[33,33],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{5}":[34,34],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{6}":[35,35],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{7}":[36,36],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{8}":[37,38],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{9}":[39,40],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{10}":[41,41],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{11}":[42,42],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{12}":[43,43],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{13}":[44,44],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{14}":[45,45],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{15}":[46,46],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{16}":[47,48],"##A Surprising Symmetry#{17}":[49,66],"##The Seven Steps":[67,184],"##The Seven Steps#{1}":[69,70],"##The Seven Steps#1\\.

There are six big categories of how people spend time. Each category is called a strategic life area, or S L A, and each one is subdivided into smaller activities, called strategic life units. The Relationships S L A, is divided into significant other, family, and friends. The Body, Mind, and Spirituality S L A, is divided into physical health and sports, mental health and mindfulness, and spirituality and faith. The Community and Society S L A, is divided into community and citizenship, and societal engagement. The Job, Learning, and Finances S L A, is divided into job and career, education and learning, and finances. The Interests and Entertainment S L A, is divided into hobbies and interests, online entertainment, and off-line entertainment. And the Personal Care S L A, is divided into physiological needs, and activities of daily living.

The exhibit shows how someone could analyze how they are spending their time on a weekly basis. It plots someone’s life activities on a 2 by 2 matrix, with the satisfaction provided by the activity on the x-axis, and the importance of the activity on the y-axis. When an activity is plotted, the size of its bubble corresponds to how much time someone spends on it in a given week. In the example, the person assigns the most importance and satisfaction to activities including family, friendship, physical health and sports, physiological needs, and finances. The 2 by 2 matrix also shows which activities someone should spend less time on, since they have higher time investment but relatively lower importance. For this person, online entertainment is an activity they could spend less time on.

The exhibit shows different activities that people spend their time doing, and how they relate to overall life satisfaction. The charts are based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which surveyed almost 100,000 people from 1984 to 20 19. The findings show that people report feeling greater life satisfaction, for example, when they are married, when they’re physically active more often, when they’re more socially engaged, and when they get seven to ten hours of sleep per night.

The exhibit shows large and small categories of how people spend their time, with the goal of helping someone better analyze what they’re using time for. There are six big categories of how people spend time. Each category is called a strategic life area, or S L A, and each one is subdivided into smaller activities, called strategic life units. The Relationships S L A, is divided into significant other, family, and friends. The Body, Mind, and Spirituality S L A, is divided into physical health and sports, mental health and mindfulness, and spirituality and faith. The Community and Society S L A, is divided into community and citizenship, and societal engagement. The Job, Learning, and Finances S L A, is divided into job and career, education and learning, and finances. The Interests and Entertainment S L A, is divided into hobbies and interests, online entertainment, and off-line entertainment. And the Personal Care S L A, is divided into physiological needs, and activities of daily living.

The exhibit shows how someone could analyze how they are spending their time on a weekly basis. It plots someone’s life activities on a 2 by 2 matrix, with the satisfaction provided by the activity on the x-axis, and the importance of the activity on the y-axis. When an activity is plotted, the size of its bubble corresponds to how much time someone spends on it in a given week. In the example, the person assigns the most importance and satisfaction to activities including family, friendship, physical health and sports, physiological needs, and finances. The 2 by 2 matrix also shows which activities someone should spend less time on, since they have higher time investment but relatively lower importance. For this person, online entertainment is an activity they could spend less time on.

The exhibit shows large and small categories of how people spend their time, with the goal of helping someone better analyze what they’re using time for. There are six big categories of how people spend time. Each category is called a strategic life area, or S L A, and each one is subdivided into smaller activities, called strategic life units. The Relationships S L A, is divided into significant other, family, and friends. The Body, Mind, and Spirituality S L A, is divided into physical health and sports, mental health and mindfulness, and spirituality and faith. The Community and Society S L A, is divided into community and citizenship, and societal engagement. The Job, Learning, and Finances S L A, is divided into job and career, education and learning, and finances. The Interests and Entertainment S L A, is divided into hobbies and interests, online entertainment, and off-line entertainment. And the Personal Care S L A, is divided into physiological needs, and activities of daily living.

The exhibit shows how someone could analyze how they are spending their time on a weekly basis. It plots someone’s life activities on a 2 by 2 matrix, with the satisfaction provided by the activity on the x-axis, and the importance of the activity on the y-axis. When an activity is plotted, the size of its bubble corresponds to how much time someone spends on it in a given week. In the example, the person assigns the most importance and satisfaction to activities including family, friendship, physical health and sports, physiological needs, and finances. The 2 by 2 matrix also shows which activities someone should spend less time on, since they have higher time investment but relatively lower importance. For this person, online entertainment is an activity they could spend less time on.

The exhibit shows different activities that people spend their time doing, and how they relate to overall life satisfaction. The charts are based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which surveyed almost 100,000 people from 1984 to 20 19. The findings show that people report feeling greater life satisfaction, for example, when they are married, when they’re physically active more often, when they’re more socially engaged, and when they get seven to ten hours of sleep per night.

The exhibit shows different activities that people spend their time doing, and how they relate to overall life satisfaction. The charts are based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which surveyed almost 100,000 people from 1984 to 20 19. The findings show that people report feeling greater life satisfaction, for example, when they are married, when they’re physically active more often, when they’re more socially engaged, and when they get seven to ten hours of sleep per night.
