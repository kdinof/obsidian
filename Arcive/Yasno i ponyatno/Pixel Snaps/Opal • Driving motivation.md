Opal leveraged the power of long-term perspective by translating immediate smartphone usage into life-scale impact. By framing their value proposition around "saving years of life" rather than "reducing daily screen time," they created a more emotionally resonant and motivating message that significantly improved trial conversion.
## Behavioral insights

— ⏰ Time Scale Reframing: The main bias that is used in this case. It shifts perspective and approaches challenges differently. Opal shows how daily behaviors are projected to have a massive lifetime impact. It makes a feeling of consequences more tangible and urgent

— 🧠 Loss Aversion: Framing a message on the screen as "achieve your dreams and get free from distractions" triggers this bias making users more likely to act to prevent losing of time

## Actions
— 🎯 Maximize Impact Framing: When designing value propositions, experiment with different time scales to find the most emotionally impactful way to present your product's benefits.

— 🔄 Connect Present to Future: Create clear visual connections between current behaviors and their long-term consequences to drive stronger user motivation.

Opal’s new approach involved projecting the time spent on smartphones over a lifetime and presenting users with the potential to save several years by using the product. This created a moment of high motivation, encouraging users to sign up for a free trial, similar to the commitment effect seen with gym memberships. The strategy not only increased trial sign-ups but also attracted users who were motivated to engage with the product. Through various iterations, the conversion rate of trial sign-ups from downloads improved from 7% to 17%.
