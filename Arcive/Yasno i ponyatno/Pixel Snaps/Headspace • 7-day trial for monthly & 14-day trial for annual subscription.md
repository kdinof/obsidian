Context
Headspace tested different free trial lengths (7, 14, and 30 days) to determine which duration maximized conversions. The final design linked a 7-day trial to monthly subscriptions and a 14-day trial to annual subscriptions, subtly nudging users toward the annual option.

Behavioral insights
🔗 Anchoring bias: Users compare the trial length options, perceiving the 14-day option as a better deal when associated with an annual commitment.
🎁 Endowment effect: Once users start using the product during the trial, they are more likely to value it and convert, especially with more extended trial periods like 14 days.
⚖️ Loss aversion: The fear of losing access to Headspace after the trial motivates users to subscribe, especially if the more extended trial feels like a more substantial “loss.”

Actions
🧠 Leverage comparative framing: Design options that make the desired outcome (annual subscription) appear as the superior choice through comparative value.
📈 Use commitment escalation: Encourage longer trials tied to long-term plans to build user investment and a sense of ownership in the product.
