## Context
The **Headspace Referral 30-Day Guest Pass experiment** was an innovative attempt by Headspace to expand its user base through a trusted referral program. Using social proof and extended free trials, the idea was to bring skeptics on board by giving them an opportunity to feel the value of the app over a longer period of time.

# Behavior tips
The key factor they have utilized here is the principle of #reciprocity when people return the kind acts of others with equally kind behaviors. Similarly, referral works: the friend is more likely to return the favor by trying the app because they have gotten something of value for free: a 30-day trial.

- #social-proof The likelihood of the use of a new service is higher in cases of recommendations by friends or relatives.
- #priming The contrast and bright image in the redesign screen gives more sense of calm and friendship than an empty screen on the screen before redesign.
