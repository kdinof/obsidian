**Context**
HotelTonight removed the requirement to create an account during checkout to reduce friction and increase bookings. The new version only asked for basic information like name and email and used a password reset link instead of making an account.

**Behavioral Insights**
• ⚙️ **Avoiding Friction**: Users are more likely to quit if the process is too long or complicated, especially during checkout.
• 🧠 **Reducing Mental Effort**: Making decisions simpler helps users focus on booking instead of worrying about passwords or extra steps.
• ⚡ **Instant Satisfaction**: A simpler process makes the booking experience quicker and less frustrating, encouraging users to complete their reservations.

**Suggested Actions**
• ✂️ **Reduce Friction**: Regularly check the user journey to find and remove steps that cause people to quit.
• 📅 **Make It Easy First**: Let users select dates and confirm the room before asking them to make an account or give extra details.
