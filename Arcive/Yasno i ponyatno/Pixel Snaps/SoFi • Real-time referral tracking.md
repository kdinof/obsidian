SoFi sought to boost user referrals, which were previously low at 2%, by enhancing the referral process with real-time tracking. This gave users transparency into their friends’ sign-up progress, making engaging and motivating them to complete the process easier. 

## Behavioral insights
📊 Progress Tracking Bias: People are more motivated to complete tasks when they can see clear progress indicators, which creates a sense of advancement and control.
👥 Social Proof in Action: Watching friends move through signup stages creates social validation and FOMO, making both referrers and referred users more likely to follow through.
🎯 Reward Anticipation Loop: Visual progress tracking triggers dopamine release through anticipated rewards, making the referral process itself more engaging even before the actual reward.

## Actions
🔍 Make Invisible Progress Visible: In any user journey where waiting is involved, create clear progress indicators to maintain engagement and reduce uncertainty.
⚡ Leverage Real-time Updates: When designing features that depend on other users' actions, implement live status updates to create momentum and maintain user interest.
🎮 Gamify Waiting Periods: Transform passive waiting times into engaging experiences by adding progress tracking and clear next steps to maintain user motivation.
