It’s quite typical when joining a new team or company as a design lead start structuring design processes and when it comes to implement requirement for creating task with a description in Jira you often face with significant resistance.

So, why is making a task description and project requirements important for the designers, and how can that save time for the whole team?

**Why it’s important to just sit and write***
Writing is a linear, focused process, unlike reactive, nonlinear, and chaotic thinking. In writing, we test the functioning of our brain because we try to fold chaotic thoughts in structured text. We question ourselves, face doubts, catch new ideas. That would not have happened if an idea was stuck in your head.


**Why writing increases efficiency**
Do you remember the game “Telephone” or “Chinese whisper”? This was a popular children’s game in which messages are whispered from person to person and then the original and final messages are compared. This game shows how information can change when it been told and now written. Moreover, we remember only 50% of the information after 10 minutes it was heard on presentation or somewhere else.
If we do not write down tasks, ideas, projects, and say them out loud, we will face with misunderstandings or misinformation in a team. Every teammate will have their own understanding of the task or of the project.
It’s counter-instinctive, yet spending time on the writing of docs or a description of a task saves one’s time, increases efficiency, and avoids misunderstandings.

**Why quality is the biggest enemy**
The document and project description is not a static document, it is always changing, updating, commenting. The sooner you publish it the faster you get feedback and start to align the team. Counting too much on quality is a first sign of procrastination.


**Why quality is the biggest enemy**
A description of the project or idea is not a static document. The quicker it is published, the sooner feedback can be received and the team aligned. Over-investing into perfecting the description is much too often a sign of procrastination.

Since the description will evolve over time, it’s best to start with a simple outline, rather than getting bogged down by details at the start. Over time, the context will build. I like the tweet → thread → essay framework, which suggests starting with a brief summary, collaborating, and then progressively developing it into a full essay.

Main takeaways from this article:
-  Writing transforms chaotic thoughts into structured ideas, helping to clarify thinking and uncover insights that may not emerge otherwise.
- Documenting ideas and tasks reduces misunderstandings and miscommunication, making teamwork more efficient, especially in remote and asynchronous work environments.
- Focusing too much on creating perfect descriptions at the outset can delay progress; it’s better to start with a simple outline and refine it over time.
- Start with a brief overview of an idea and gradually develop it through collaboration, evolving into a more detailed document over time. Tweet → Thread → Essay
