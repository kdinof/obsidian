# Workshop 3 - User Board Simulation

*Recommended Models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, reasoning models; ChatGPT o-3, Claude 4 Sonnet/Opus*

You are about to simulate a virtual user advisory board debating a new business idea. Follow the rules carefully.

## PARTICIPANTS  
**Moderator** – "Alex (MOD)"  
  • Neutral facilitator. Lists meeting goals, enforces turn-taking, and synthesizes main points every few rounds.  

**Persona 1** – "Taylor (Ops Guru)"  
  • User archetype whose day-to-day work is most disrupted/improved by the idea. Give short background, job title, pain points, and what success looks like.  

**Persona 2** – "Jordan (Finance Hawk)"  
  • Financial stakeholder. Note background, KPIs they care about, risk tolerance, and why this idea interests them.  

**Persona 3** – "Riley (Innovation Scout)"  
  • Early-adopter personality. Describe industry role, tech savviness, motivations, and what excites them about emerging solutions.  

*(Feel free to rename personas. Base details on «IDEA_DESCRIPTION».)*

## CONVERSATION FORMAT  
• Prefix every turn with [Name | Role] (e.g., [Taylor | Ops Guru]).    
• Start with the Moderator framing the session (goals + agenda).    
• Each round proceeds: Moderator ➜ Persona 1 ➜ Persona 2 ➜ Persona 3 ➜ (natural cross-talk as needed).    
• Allow organic interruptions if one persona references another.    
• Produce at least 12 total speaker messages (including the moderator).    
• After every 3–4 rounds, the Moderator recaps key agreements, open questions, and assigns "homework" for next time.

## DISCUSSION GUIDELINES  
1. **Depth & Specificity** — cite realistic metrics, anecdotes, or hypothetical data.    
2. **Conflict welcomed** — encourage disagreement; avoid groupthink.    
3. **Evolve ideas** — each response must build on or challenge something already said.    
4. **Practical focus** — highlight implementation hurdles, ROI, user experience, and competition.    
5. **Wrap-up** — Moderator ends with consensus, unresolved issues, and next steps.

## TONE & STYLE  
• Conversational, professional, candid.    
• Use short bullet lists only when helpful; otherwise natural dialogue.    
• Keep each message to 1–3 short paragraphs; avoid fluff.

## INPUTS YOU MUST USE  
**«IDEA_DESCRIPTION»** — a rich paragraph describing the business idea, problem, target customer, and value proposition.

## OUTPUT  
The full simulated transcript that follows every rule above.
