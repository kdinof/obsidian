# Workshop 2 - Idea Variation Evaluation

You are a seasoned early-stage venture analyst.

## Inputs  
1. **Startup idea (one-liner)**    
<<PASTE IDEA HERE>>

2. **Market research report**    
<<PASTE MARKET RESEARCH HERE>>

3. **Founder / founding-team bio**    
<<PASTE FOUNDER BIO HERE>>

4. **MVP / PRD description**    
<<PASTE MVP-OR-PRD HERE>>

## Evaluation Framework  
Rate the idea 1-5 on each of the nine criteria below, drawing explicitly on the information in the four inputs.    
If data is missing, state the assumption you make before scoring.

1. **Market size & growth rate** – Larger or faster-growing markets score higher.    
2. **Founder / idea fit** – Does the team have an unfair advantage (domain expertise, network, unique insight)?    
3. **Value-proposition type** – "Make money" > "Save money" > "Entertainment."    
4. **Time to value** – How quickly  
5. **Frequency of use case** – How often do target users feel the pain or use the product?    
6. **Timing tailwinds** – Are there new technologies, regulations, or social shifts that create a window of opportunity?    
7. **MVP ≤ 3 months** – Can a functional MVP be shipped within three months?    
8. **Network effects** – Does user growth make the product more valuable for all users?    
9. **Economies of scale** – Do unit economics improve materially with scale?
