# Description

**New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USAToday Bestseller for May 2022**

Tony Fadell led the teams that created the iPod, iPhone and Nest Learning Thermostat and learned enough in 30+ years in Silicon Valley about leadership, design, startups, Apple, Google, decision-making, mentorship, devastating failure and unbelievable success to fill an encyclopedia.

So that’s what this book is. An advice encyclopedia. A mentor in a box. 

Written for anyone who wants to grow at work—from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company—Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.

Each quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony’s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor. Tony uses examples that are instantly captivating, like the process of building the very first iPod and iPhone. Every chapter is designed to help readers with a problem they’re facing right now—how to get funding for their startup, whether to quit their job or not, or just how to deal with the jerk in the next cubicle.

Tony forged his path to success alongside mentors like Steve Jobs and Bill Campbell, icons of Silicon Valley who succeeded time and time again. But Tony doesn’t follow the Silicon Valley credo that you have to reinvent everything from scratch to make something great. His advice is unorthodox because it’s old school. Because Tony’s learned that human nature doesn’t change. You don’t have to reinvent how you lead and manage—just what you make. 

And Tony’s ready to help everyone make things worth making.

# Notes

This advice is unorthodox because it’s old-school. The religion of Silicon Valley is reinvention, disruption—blowing up old ways of thinking and proposing new ones. But certain things you can’t blow up. ==Human nature doesn’t change, regardless of what you’re building, where you live, how old you are, how wealthy or not.== And over the last thirty-plus years I’ve seen what humans need to reach their potential, to disrupt what needs disrupting, to forge their own unorthodox path.

A good mentor won’t hand you the answers, but they will try to help you see your problem from a new perspective. They’ll loan you some of their hard-fought advice so you can discover your own solution.

When I talk to people fresh out of college or early in their careers, that’s what they’re looking for. An opportunity to make an impact and set themselves on a path to make something great.

## Chapter 1.1 Adulthood

**Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less.**

So when you’re looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is this: “What do I want to learn?”
- Not “How much money do I want to make?”
- Not “What title do I want to have?”
- Not “What company has enough name recognition that my mom can brutally crush the other moms when they boast about their kids?”

The best way to find a job you’ll love and a career that will eventually make you successful is to follow what you’re naturally interested in, then take risks when choosing where to work. **Follow your curiosity rather than a business school playbook about how to make money.**

> The only failure in your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error

And you can’t skip a step—you can’t just have the answers handed to you and detour around the hard stuff. **Humans learn through productive struggle, by trying it themselves and screwing up and doing it differently next time.**

From the moment you’re born until you move out of your parents’ house, almost all your choices are made, shaped, or influenced by your parents.

And after you move out of your parents’ house, there’s a window—a brief, shining, incredible window—where your decisions are yours alone.

## Chapter 1.2 Get a Job

If you’re going to throw your time, energy, and youth at a company, try to join one that’s not just making a better mousetrap. Find a business that’s starting a revolution. A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo has the following characteristics:
1. It’s creating a product or service that’s wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can’t make or even understand.
2. This product solves a problem—a real pain point—that a lot of customers experience daily. There should be an existing large market.
3. The novel technology can deliver on the company vision—not just within the product but also the infrastructure, platforms, and systems that support it.
4. Leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers’ needs.
5. It’s thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it.

If you get a foot in the door at a growing company, you’ll find opportunities to grow, too.

Just whatever you do, don’t become a “management consultant” at a behemoth like McKinsey or Bain or one of the other eight consultancies
that dominate the industry. ==They all have thousands upon thousands of employees and work almost exclusively with Fortune 5000 companies. These corporations, typically led by tentative, risk-averse CEOs, call in the management consultants to do a massive audit, find the flaws, and present leadership with a new plan that will magically “fix” everything.== What a fairy tale—don’t get me started.
But to many new grads, it sounds perfect: you get paid incredibly well to travel around the world, work with powerful companies and executives, and learn exactly how to make a business successful. It’s an alluring promise.
Parts of it are even true. Yes, you get a nice paycheck. And yes, you get plenty of practice pitching important clients. But you don’t learn how to build or run a company. Not really.

Steve Jobs once said of management consulting: 
> You do get a broad cut at companies but it’s very thin. It’s like a picture of a banana: you might get a very accurate picture but it’s only two dimensions, and without the experience of actually doing it you never get three dimensional. So you might have a lot of pictures on your walls, you can show it off to your friends—I’ve worked in bananas, I’ve worked in peaches, I’ve worked in grapes—but you never really taste it.

To do great things, to really learn, you can’t shout suggestions from the rooftop then move on while someone else does the work. You have to get your hands dirty. You have to care about every step, lovingly craft every detail. You have to be there when it falls apart so you can put it back together.

**You have to actually do the job. You have to love the job**

**If you’re passionate about something—something that could be solving a huge problem one day—then stick with it.**

## Chapter 1.3 Heroes

Students seek out the best professors on the best projects when getting their master’s or PhD, but when they look for jobs, they focus on money, perks, and titles. However, the only thing that can make a job truly amazing or a complete waste of time is the people. Focus on understanding your field and use that knowledge to create connections with the best of the best, people you truly respect. Your heroes. Those (typically humble) rock stars will lead you to the career you want.

Once you’re armed with that knowledge, then you can start hunting down the people who are the best of the best and trying to work with them. And that doesn’t mean stalking Elon Musk if you’re into electric cars. Look at who reports to him. And who reports to them. And which competing company would kill to hire those people. Understand the subdisciplines and see who leads the one you’re most interested in. Find the experts on Twitter or YouTube, then send them a message, a comment, a LinkedIn connection. You’re interested in the same things, you have the same passions—so share your point of view, ask a smart question, or just tell them about some fascinating minutiae that your family and friends find deeply, desperately, unfathomably boring.

You could go to Google, Apple, Facebook, or some other giant company, but it’ll be hard to maneuver yourself to work closely with the rock stars. And you should know you’re not going to make a real impact. Not for a long time. ==You’re a pebble bouncing off an elephant==. **But you’ll be a well-paid pebble eating free kale chips, so if you do go that route enjoy the paycheck while working on your tiny piece of some vast and endless project.**

## Chapter 1.4. Don’t (Only) Look Down

However, if an IC is constantly looking down, their eyes exclusively on their own tight deadlines and the minutiae of their job, they may walk directly into a brick wall.

As an IC, you need to occasionally do two things:
1. Look up: Look beyond the next deadline or project and forward to all the milestones coming up in the next few months. Then look all the way down to your ultimate goal: the mission. Ideally it should be the reason you joined the project in the first place. As your project progresses, be sure the mission still makes sense to you and that the path to reach it seems achievable.
2. Look around: Get out of your comfort zone and away from the immediate team you’re on. Talk to the other functions in your company to understand their perspectives, needs, and concerns. This internal networking is always useful and it can give you an early warning if your project is not headed in the right direction.

Your executive team and managers are supposed to be looking out for roadblocks. They’re supposed to warn you so you can adjust course, or at least grab a helmet.
But sometimes they don’t.
So 20 percent of the time, individual contributors need to look up. And they need to look around. The sooner they start, the faster and higher they’ll advance in their career.

New perspectives are everywhere. You don’t have to drag a bunch of people off the street to stare at your product and tell you what they think. Start with your internal customers. Everyone in a company has customers, even if they’re not building anything.

And talk to the people who are closest to the customer, like marketing and support—find teams who communicate with customers day in and day out and hear their feedback directly.

# Part II Build Your Career

## Chapter 2.1. Just Managing

1. You do not have to be a manager to be successful. Many people assume that the only path to more money and stature is managing a team. However, there are alternatives that will enable you to get a similar paycheck, have similar amounts of influence, and possibly be happier overall.
2. Remember that once you become a manager, you’ll stop doing the thing that made you successful in the first place. You’ll no longer be doing the things you do really well—instead you’ll be digging into how others do them, helping them improve. Your job will now be communication, communication, communication, recruiting, hiring and firing, setting budgets, reviews, one-on-one meetings (1:1s), meetings with your team and other teams and leadership, representing your team in those meetings, setting goals and keeping people on track, conflict resolution, helping to find creative solutions to intractable problems, blocking and tackling political BS, mentoring your team, and asking “how can I help you?” all the time.
3. Being exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement. Your job is to make sure the team produces high-quality work. It only turns into micromanagement when you dictate the step-by-step process by which they create that work rather than focusing on the output.
5. Honesty is more important than style. Everyone has a style—loud, quiet, emotional, analytical, excited, reserved. You can be successful with any style as long as you never shy away from respectfully telling the team the uncomfortable, hard truth that needs to be said.
6. Don’t worry that your team will outshine you. In fact, it’s your goal. You should always be training someone on your team to do your job. The better they are, the easier it is for you to move up and even start managing managers.

==The more things go wrong, the more you fall back on doing what you know. And you know accounting. So instead of becoming a better accounting manager, you focus on being the best accountant on the team.==

Because once you’re a manager, you’re no longer an accountant. Or a designer. Or a fisherman. Or an artist. Or whatever it is you really enjoyed doing. I constantly have to remind people: If you’re doing what you loved in your old job, then you’re probably doing the wrong thing. You now lead a team of people doing what you used to be good at. ==So at least 85 percent of your time should be spent managing. If it’s not, then you aren’t doing it right. Managing is the job. And managing is hard.==

When you’re a manager, you’re no longer just responsible for the work. You’re responsible for human beings. And while that seems obvious—yes, that’s the whole point of the job—it’s a difficult thing to grapple with when all of a sudden eighty people are looking at you, expecting you to know how to lead them.

A star individual contributor (IC) is incredibly valuable. Valuable enough that many companies will pay them just as much as they’d pay a become an informal cultural leader, someone who people across the manager. A truly great IC will be a leader in their chosen function and also company will seek out for advice and mentorship.

One of the hardest parts of management is letting go. Not doing the work yourself. You have to temper your fear that becoming more hands-off will cause the product to suffer or the project to fail. You have to trust your team—give them breathing room to be creative and opportunities to shine.

Examining the product in great detail and caring deeply about the quality of what your team is producing is not micromanagement. That’s exactly what you should be doing.

As a manager, you should be focused on making sure the team is producing the best possible product. The outcome is your business. How the team reaches that outcome is the team’s business.

Then they make sure everything’s heading in the right direction in regular team meetings.
These meetings should be structured to get you and the team as much clarity as possible. You should have a weekly crib sheet that helps you keep your priorities and the questions you need to ask top of mind.

The other place where you’ll get useful data is in 1:1s with team members. It’s all too easy to turn 1:1s into friendly chats that go nowhere, so just as you need to have a process for your team meetings, your weekly meetings with individuals should have an agenda, a clear purpose, and should be beneficial to both sides. You should get the info you need about product development and your team members should get insight into how they’re doing. Try to see the situation from their point of view—talk about their fears and your own concerns out loud, reframe your thoughts so they can hear the feedback, understand the goals, clear up ambiguities or concerns.

If you’ve been promoted to management for the first time, you’re probably managing
 people who used to be your peers. Peers who know and trust you. So hold on to that trust. Tell them, “I know I’m your manager now, but we can still talk just like we always have.” And then just be honest with them. Even if things aren’t going well, don’t avoid telling them the hard truth. Tear off the Band-Aid. If either of you is nervous, you can start the conversation with something positive, ease into it, but don’t ignore the elephant in the room, don’t tiptoe around the reason you need to talk. It’s important to remember that even if you have to criticize someone’s work or their behavior, you’re not doing it to hurt them. You’re there to help. Every word should come from a place of caring. So tell them what’s holding them back. Then make a plan to work on it together.

==I started reading management books and realized that a great deal of management comes down to how you manage your own fears and anxieties.==


## Chapter 2.2. Data Versus Opinion

Data-driven: You can acquire, study, and debate facts and numbers that will allow you to be fairly confident in your choice. These decisions are relatively easy to make and defend and most people on the team can agree on the answer.

Opinion-driven: You have to follow your gut and your vision for what you want to do, without the benefit of sufficient data to guide you or back you up. These decisions are always hard and always questioned—after all, everyone has an opinion.

Every decision has elements of data and opinion, but they are ultimately driven by one or the other. ==Sometimes you have to double down on the data; other times you have to look at all the data and then trust your gut.== And trusting your gut is incredibly scary. Many people don’t have either a good gut instinct to follow or the faith in themselves to follow it. It takes time to develop that trust. So they try to turn an opinion-driven business decision into a data-driven one. But data can’t solve an opinion-based problem. So no matter how much data you get, it will always be inconclusive. This leads to analysis paralysis—death by overthinking.

If you don’t have enough data to make a decision, you’ll need insights to inform your opinion. Insights can be key learnings about your customers or your market or your product space—something substantial that gives you an intuitive feeling for what you should do.

Except customer panels can’t design for shit. People just can’t articulate what they want clearly enough to definitely point in one direction or another, especially if they’re considering something completely new that they’ve never used before. Customers will always be more comfortable with what exists already, even if it’s terrible.

So you’d run the test. And then run it again. On Monday the customerpanel would pick option X. On Friday, the same group would go withoption Y. Meanwhile, we were paying millions of dollars to consultantswho took a month and a half to put their own slant on everything.
==The data wasn’t a guide. At best, it was a crutch. At worst, cement shoes. It was analysis paralysis.==

Despite the fact that many companies now rabidly test every single element of their product and unquestioningly follow the clicks, A/B and user testing is not product design. It’s a tool. A test. At best, a diagnosis. It can tell you something’s not working, but it won’t tell you how to fix it.

You need a hypothesis, and that hypothesis should be part of a bigger product vision. So you can A/B test where the “Buy” button should go on a Web page, whether it should be blue or orange, but you shouldn’t be testing whether or not a customer should buy online. 
If you’re testing the core of your product, if the basic functionality can flex and change depending on the whims of an A/B test, then there is no core. There’s a hole where your product vision should be and you’re just shoveling data into the void.

Even if some people on your team don’t love that answer, they’ll respect it. And they’ll trust you—they’ll know that they can speak up and criticize your choices and not get immediately shot down.

Most people don’t even want to acknowledge that there are opinion- driven decisions or that they have to make them. Because if you follow your gut and your gut is wrong, then there’s nowhere else to cast blame. But if all you did was follow the data and you still failed, then clearly something else was wrong. Someone else screwed up.

That’s why some managers and execs and shareholders demand data even when there is none and then chase that imaginary data directly into the abyss. These are the kinds of people who won’t question their directions and drive their car right off a cliff. ==If at all possible they want to erase the human element—human judgment—from the equation.==

Here are a few reasons why a leader may sit on your idea and then call in the consultants:

1. Delay. They may be waiting for something—a promotion or a bonus— and don’t want to take a risk until they get it.

2. Fear for their job. They may be convinced that the consequence of failure is that they’ll lose this project or their position or—if the failure is spectacular enough—their job.

3. They don’t have the time or don’t want to bother. They don’t believe it’s worth the effort to dig in and really understand the decision, choose from the array of options before them, and take a risk. They just want someone else to do it and make them look smart.
4. They know what they want but don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. They want to be seen as “nice” so they’ll just keep testing the water, asking for more data again and again until you’re worn out and exasperated.

Storytelling is how you get people to take a leap of faith to do something new. It’s what all our big choices ultimately come down to— believing a story we tell ourselves or that someone else tells us. Creating a believable narrative that everyone can latch on to is critical to moving forward and making hard choices. It’s all that marketing comes down to. It’s the heart of sales.
==And right now you’re selling—your vision, your gut, your opinion.==
So don’t just hit them with the classic “This is Jane, this is her life, and this is how her life changes when she uses our product” slide. Helping people see things from the customer’s perspective is a critical tool, but it’s just part of what you need to do.

Nothing in the world is ever 100 percent sure. Even scientific research with entirely data-based outcomes is actually filled with caveats—we didn’t do this kind of sampling, there was this variant, we need to follow up with this test.

==So you can’t wait for perfect data. It doesn’t exist. You just have to take that first step into the unknown.==

==Most decisions we make are data-informed, but they’re not data-made.==
==As the brilliant, empathetic, refreshingly insightful, and egoless designer Ivy Ross, vice president of hardware design at Google, has said, “It’s not data or intuition; it’s data and intuition.”==

## Chapter 2.3. Assholes

You’ll find them at all levels, as individual contributors and managers, but the greatest concentration is near the top—according to University of San Diego professor Simon Croom, up to 12 percent of corporate senior leadership exhibit psychopathic traits.

It’s the responsibility of a passionate person—especially a leader—to describe their decision and make sure you can see it through their eyes. If they can tell you why they’re so passionate about something, then you can piece together their thought process and either jump on board or point out potential issues.

## Chapter 2.4 I Quit
1. You’re no longer passionate about the mission. If you’re staying for the paycheck or to get the title you want, but every hour at your desk feels like an eternity, then save yourself. Whatever you’re staying for is not worth the soul-sucking misery of a job you cannot bear to get out of bed for.

2. You’ve tried everything. You’re still passionate about the mission but the company is letting you down. So you’ve talked to your manager, to other teams, to HR, and to senior leadership. You’ve tried to understand the roadblocks and pitched solutions and options. But still, your project is going nowhere or your manager is impossible or the company is falling apart. In that case, you should leave that job but stick to the mission and find another team on a similar journey.

==And I want to make it very clear: hating your job is never worth the money.==
I need to repeat that: hating your job is never worth whatever raise, title, or perks they throw at you to stay.
I’ve gotten wealthy is not by accepting giant paychecks or titles to do jobs I know I’ll hate. I follow my curiosity and my passion.

You don’t respect your manager, you roll your eyes at the mission, you stagger out the door at the end of the day exhausted, dragging yourself home to complain to family and friends until they’re as miserable as you are. It is time and energy and health and joy that disappear from your life forever. But hey, that title, that stature, that money—it’s worth it all, right?

I just mean make new relationships, beyond business—talk to people outside your bubble. ==Get to know what else is out there. Meet some new human beings. Networking is something you should be doing constantly—even when you’re happily employed== 

You should talk to people and make connections because you’re naturally curious. You want to know how other teams at your company work and what people do. You want to talk to your competitors because you’re all working to solve the same problems and they’re taking a different approach.

==*People won’t remember how you started. They’ll remember how you left.*==

If you’ve found a good opportunity to follow your passions, you should not give up until you’ve tried to make it work at the company you’re at.

The threat of leaving may be enough to push your company to get serious and make whatever change you’re asking for. But it might not. ==Quitting should never be a negotiating tactic—it should be the very last card you play.==

Quitting anytime things get tough not only doesn’t look great on your résumé, but it also kills any chance you have of making something you’re proud of. Good things take time. Big things take longer. If you flit from project to project, company to company, you’ll never have the vital experience of starting and finishing something meaningful.

So before you quit, you’d better have a story. A good, credible, and factual one. You’ll need to have a rationale for why you left. And you’ll need one for why you want to join whatever company you’re heading to next.

==Your story about why you left needs to be honest and fair and your story for your next job needs to be inspiring: this is what I want to learn, this is the kind of team I want to work with, this is part of the mission that truly excites me.==

Knowing when to quit and follow a recruiter is a two- stage process: first you have to know your job is no longer for you, and then you have to decide the new place is better. Too many people conflate the two, get dazzled by the recruiter’s sales proposition, and ignore the opportunities they have where they work right now. Or they don’t network internally, so they don’t even realize what opportunities there are. I’ve seen too many people jump ship before doing their research and really thinking things through. They usually come back three to six months later, tail between their legs, sheepishly asking for their old job back.

# Part III Build Your Product

## Chapter 3.1 Make the Intangible Tangible

We’re wired to focus our attention on tangible things that we can see and touch to the point that we overlook the importance of intangible experiences and feelings. But when you’re creating a new product, regardless of whether it’s made of atoms or electrons, for businesses or consumers, the actual thing you’re building is only one tiny part of a vast, intangible, overlooked user journey that starts long before a customer ever gets their hands on your product and ends long after.

Of course, sometimes you do need hardware—it can’t be avoided. But when that happens, I still tell people to put it away. I say, “Don’t tell me what’s so special about this object. Tell me what’s different about the customer journey.”
==Your product isn’t only your product.== 
==It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons.==

Your customer doesn’t differentiate between your advertising and your app and your customer support agents—all of it is your company. Your brand. All of it is one thing.

To do that right, you have to prototype the whole experience—give every part the weight and reality of a physical object.

Regardless of whether your product is made of atoms or bits or both, the process is the same. Draw pictures. Make models. Pin mood boards. Sketch out the bones of the process in rough wireframes. Write imaginary press releases. Create detailed mock-ups that show how a customer would travel from an ad to the website to the app and what information they would see at each touchpoint. Write up the reactions you’d want to get from early adopters, the headlines you’d want to see from reviewers, the feelings you want to evoke in everyone. Make it visible. Physical. Get it out of your head and onto something you can touch. And don’t wait until your product is done to get started—map out the whole journey as you map out what your product will do.
