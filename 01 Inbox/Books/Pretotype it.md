# Pretotype it

# Notes 
---
#### About This 10th Anniversary Edition
You must test the market for your ideas because most new products and businesses fail due to insufficient mar- ket interest. With pretotyping, you can quickly and con- fidently determine the market’s level of interest in your idea before you go through the hassle and expense of turning it into a product or a business.

#### This Is Embarrassing!
“If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.”

#### What About Building Prototypes?
And the more you invest in something, the harder it is to let it go and admit you’ve been building the wrong thing.

Prototypes often turn into productypes (a prototype taken too far), and by then there’s no turning back.

**Prototypes should be built to answer questions such as, “Can we build it?”, “Will it work as expected?”, or “How will people use it?”** These are important questions that you need to eventually answer. But an even more im- portant question that you need to answer first is: “Is there a big enough market for this new product?” Answering this last question is where pretotypes come in.

 >[!tip] Pretotypes occupy the space between abstract ideas and prototypes
 
pretotyping helps you fail fast, recover fast, and leaves you plenty of time, money, energy, and enthu- siasm to explore new ideas (or tweaks to your original idea) until you hit on something that people will want.

### CHAPTER ONE: THE RIGHT IT

**The Right It is an idea for a new product that—if competently executed—will succeed in the market.**

If there’s a market, there’s a way.  
If there’s no market, there’s no way.

The goal of pretotyping is to help you weed out ideas that are destined to fail and to help you find ideas that are The Right It. And to do so with the minimum investment of time, money, and effort.

### CHAPTER TWO: PRETOTYPING

#### IBM translation example 

#### The Palm Pilot Experiment
Hawkins, 40, Palm's chief technologist and Pilot's cre- ator, designed one of the first handheld computers, the GRiDPad, a decade ago. It was an engineering marvel but a market failure because, he says, it was still too big. Determined not to make the same mistake twice, he had a ready answer when his colleagues asked him how small their new device should be: "Let's try the shirt pocket."

#### Test It Before You Invest In It
Both teams had doubts about the eventual useful- ness and market adoption of their innovation. It was a cool idea. It made sense. It solved a problem. But was it The Right It? Would people use it as envisioned?
Because of their doubts, both teams wanted to test the usefulness of their idea with a prototype and collect feedback from real-world usage of the prod- uct (as opposed to opinions about the product) be- fore committing to its development.

#### Pretotyping Defined
*Pretotyping is a way to test an idea as quickly and in- expensively as possible by creating artifacts to help us test the hypotheses that "if we build it, they will buy it” and/or “if we build it, they will use it.”*
Make sure—as quickly and as cheaply as you can— that you are building The Right It before you build It right.

#### Pretotyping And Prototyping
> ask AI about difference 

how quickly and how inexpensively they can design and build a pretotype that they can use to collect data on the usability and desirabil- ity of their idea. Ideally, a pretotype-based experiment should be one or two orders of magnitude faster and cheaper to develop than a prototype-based experiment.
**pretotypes are not a replacement for prototypes.**

## CHAPTER THREE: IT WILL FAIL
Most new product ideas are destined to fail—yours included. Most new ideas are destined to fail because they are **The Wrong It**; they sound great in theory, but once developed they turn out to be nowhere near as desirable to the market, nor as useful and helpful as originally an- ticipated—regardless of how well they are designed, en- gineered, manufactured, marketed, or sold.
Unfortunately, pretotyping does not have the power to turn The Wrong It into The Right It—nothing can do that. But pretotyping will help you identify The Wrong It quickly and inexpensively, so you can keep trying new ideas (or variations on the original idea) until you find The Right It.

#### The Law Of Market Failure
**Most (80-90%) new ideas will fail in the market—even if compe- tently executed.**

#### ... Failure Is Not An Option
For any new and untested idea, failure is not an option—it’s the most likely outcome!

#### Good Failure Hunting
They say that failure is a great teacher. I agree. All fail- ures have a cost; they take something from you. But they also teach you something. Failure can yield valuable morsels of data, lessons to learn. The trick is to make sure that you don’t pay too much of a failure tax for that data and those lessons—that is what marks the difference be- tween bad failure and good failure:

Bad failure: Cost of failure > Value of lesson
Good failure: Cost of failure < Value of lesson

#### The Beast of Failure
You must be ready to toss sacrificial morsels of your ideas at the beast and run away. If you are not nimble; if you get too attached to your idea; if you invest too much to develop your idea before testing it, it is you that might end up taking a journey through the belly of the beast.

#### Three Ways To Fail
You have three options for dealing with the potential fail- ure of your idea:
- Drop It. The first way is to simply drop your idea and do nothing about it.
- Go for It. The second way of dealing with failure is the exact oppo- site of the first. Instead of laziness, insecurity, and cow- ardice, you show excessive eagerness, confidence, and hubris.
- Test It. Test It is the Golden Mean between Drop It and Go for It. Fortune favors the brave—not the cowards, nor the reckless.

#### Lost In Thoughtland
Although polar opposites, Drop It and Go for It have one thing in common: they both involve lots of thinking, lots of talking, and very little real-world interaction.
Thoughtland is a fictional place inhabited by two ghostly entities that bounce around and interact with each other: ideas and opinions.

#### The Drop It Scenario
A good percentage of ideas fail to see the light of day simply because the people who come up with them never get off their butts. They believe the idea is a winner, other people tell them that the idea is a winner, but they are too lazy/tired/busy/broke/inexperienced/afraid/(add your fa- vorite excuse) to do something about it.
The remaining percentage of ideas fail to see the light of day not because those who come up with the idea are lazy/tired/busy/...; but because, **while in Thoughtland, those ideas attracted enough negative opinions that belief in them first wavered and then collapsed altogether.**
Since most ideas are not The Right It, negative opinions kill a lot of bad ideas. But they also kill many innocent and promising ideas that are The Right It but never get a chance.

How can an idea that receives such positive opinions turn out to be such a flop? How does Tom’s 70%-will-buy projection turn into 0.0002%-actually-bought? Well, that’s what happens when you make your decisions based on what you “learn” in Thoughtland.

**A Small Sampling Of Pretotyping Techniques**
Let’s begin with a quick overview of the techniques we’ll learn about:
- " The Mechanical Turk—Replace complex and expensive computers or machines with human beings.
- " The Pinocchio—Build a dummy, non-func- tional version of the product and bring it to life with your imagination.
- "  The Stripped Tease—Create a functional ver- sion of your idea, but stripped down to its most basic functionality.
- "  The Provincial—Before launching broadly, run a test on a very small sample.
- "  The Fake Door—Create a fake entry-point for a product that doesn’t yet exist in any form.
- "  The Pretend-to-Own—Before investing to buy whatever you need to develop your idea, rent, or borrow it first.
- "  The Re-Label—Put a different label on an ex- isting product that looks like the product you want to create.

The Mechanical Turk Pretotype
This pretotyping technique borrows its name from the fa- mous Mechanical Turk chess-playing “machine” that toured the world in the late 18th century. People were led to believe that the “Turk” was a mechanical contraption (an automaton) programmed to play chess. In reality, the box concealed a small expert chess player making the moves by manipulating the mannequin.

The Pinocchio Pretotype
This pretotyping technique was inspired by Jeff Haw- kins’ wood and paper pretotype for the PalmPilot. I named it after the wooden puppet who, after being visited by the Blue Fairy, became a real boy.
The Pinocchio pretotype is best suited for situations where factors like size, shape, weight and/or portability, are important and where one’s imagination can be used to fill in the blanks in terms of functionality—much the same way Hawkins’ pretended that his wood block had the functionality required to schedule appointments, store phone numbers, and keep notes.

The Stripped Tease Pretotype
If a new product is something that people really, really want, they will put up with limited features and rough edges. The Stripped Tease pretotype takes advantage of this fact.

The Fake Door
The name of this technique comes from a presentation by Jess Lee, co-founder and VP of Products for Polyvore. Thanks, Jess!
With a Fake Door pretotype, all you have to do is create an entry point for a new product (or new feature). The product (or feature) does not have to exist yet. In Jess’s words, “In a web product, what this means is that you pretend that a feature exists, and you see if anybody clicks on it.”
Fake Door pretotypes are useful for determining the ini- tial level of interest for an idea (more about initial level of interest later).


CHAPTER FIVE: TEST IT

The most reliable way to determine if your idea is likely to be The Right It is to test it on its target market—not by asking questions and collecting opinions in Thoughtland, but in the real world and using pretotypes to collect data from actual users.

Initial Level of Interest (ILI)

The first metric you should use to test the market’s inter- est in your idea is Initial Level of Interest, ILI for short.
ILI is a simple ratio:
ILI = number of actions taken / number of oppor- tunities for action offered
Where:
number of opportunities for action offered repre- sents the number of people who have been offered an opportunity to take an action which indicates that they are interested in the idea, and number of actions taken represents the number of people who have taken that action.
