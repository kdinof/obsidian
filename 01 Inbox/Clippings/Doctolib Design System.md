**We use photography as it showcases real life representations, when we aim to communicate on an emotional level with our users.**

Communication that aims to create an emotional connection with our users can be around our brand values, our mission (brand campaigns), our company's culture (career website), a story of people using our products (documentary, portrait), etc.

Doctolib photography is all about being candid, close to the reality. We are people-oriented and focused on their lives. This humility should show through our images.

The following principles will show you how our photography style adapts across all of our communications. Making them unique and relevant at the same time.

## Movement

We are **passionate**, that's why our photography must be in **MOVEMENT**.

Dynamic and moving photographs allow the viewer to feel part of the story and better communicate real life situations. We avoid posed photographs and static images that communicate an artificial message and lack of empathy.

The viewer must feel that something is happening. The movements are authentic, simple and they express the professionalism and care of Doctolib solutions.

The action must show the experience behind the different professions: during a photo shoot, for example, the actors must be trained by doctors and reproduce professional gestures. This will help us to replicate real life and convey a feeling of authenticity.

## Human Touch

We are **caring**, that’s why our photography must always have a **HUMAN TOUCH**.

The human contact can be represented through a scene, or focused on a gesture. We avoid emotions and attitudes that look forced or fake. We aim to represent real life and all its nuances.

We want to photograph reality including the benefits of Doctolib in our daily life and all the moments that matter (e.g. first visit to the pediatrician, the physiotherapist who helps you walk again, the family doctor who has known you for years etc.). We represent the caring, affective and natural relationship between doctors and patients.

## Diversity

We are **trustworthy**, that’s why our photography must always promote **DIVERSITY**.

We aim to improve health for all, so our photography must represent everyone (gender, race, age, ability, culture, etc.). We avoid standard and neutral people representation.

## User-centricity

We believe **innovation** thrives when you put people first. That’s why our photographs must always put the **USER AT THE CENTER** of the action.

We want to focus on people and their use of our solutions. We don't want to focus on the products themselves. Our photographs are focused on the users and their experiences with our solutions.
