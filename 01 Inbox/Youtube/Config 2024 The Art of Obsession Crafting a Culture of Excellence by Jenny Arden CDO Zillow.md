## Arguments
### Obsessing Over Details
Meticulous attention to detail is essential for creating a culture of excellence. The success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs illustrates how sweating the small stuff can lead to groundbreaking achievements.

### Role of a Chief Design Officer
A CDO balances user and business needs, ensuring that strategies consider both aspects. The CDO is responsible for the overall experience and the quality of the final product.

### Achieving a Design Golden Era
A design Golden Era occurs when a group of creative minds produce their best work. Key ingredients include visionary leadership, a dedicated team, a company that values quality, and an environment ripe for change.

### Importance of Leadership
A leader with clarity and vision can inspire and motivate a team to achieve greatness. Such leaders believe in pushing the limits and communicate their vision effectively.

### Team Dynamics
A team that cares about the work and is invested in the outcome is crucial for achieving excellence. Teams that push each other and celebrate collective achievements create a thriving environment for innovation.

### Value of Quality
For a company to achieve a design Golden Era, it must tie its business strategy to the quality of the work. Everyone in the company should understand what quality means and strive to achieve it.

### Role of AI in Design
AI can assist in achieving good results, but human involvement is necessary for true innovation and attention to detail. AI lacks the nuance and creativity that humans bring to the design process.

### Embracing Change
A design Golden Era requires a fundamental change in human needs, a sense of discomfort in the company, and users ready for new solutions. Companies must recognize design as a driver of future opportunities.

### Learning from Past Successes
Historical examples, such as Disney, Nike, Apple, and Google, show how attention to detail and visionary leadership can lead to iconic achievements and lasting impact.

### Overcoming Challenges
Despite challenges like budget constraints and skepticism, believing in the vision and pushing forward can lead to extraordinary success. Companies must focus on the output and strive for excellence.

## A leader with clarity

**A touch of insanity** Believes that anything is possible. Willing to bend reality and see what others cannot.
**Can transfer energy** Able to generate excitement and bring them back to that feeling whenever it gets tough.
**Communicates until everyone gets it** Continuously communicates why the work matters in all forms (written, visual, orated...)

## A team that cares about the work

**Each person amplifies each other** The team pushes each other to create great work. Everyone knows how to contribute.
**Personal connection with the work** The idea that you can put 6-10 hours a day into work and not care is a falsehood.
**Believes in mastering a craft** Everyone is aiming to grow and master their craft at their highest ability.


## A company that values quality

**Ties quality to business goals** The company has created a strategy that directly connects the quality of the experience to the financial success of the company.
**Sets a high bar, gives it adequate time** A bar is set to define what great looks like and deadlines give people just enough time to meet that bar.
**Output is owned cross-functionally** Everyone is responsible for the outcome. It does not rest on a single person or function.
