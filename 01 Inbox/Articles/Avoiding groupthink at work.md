# Description

The experience is fine, but ==you’ll never know if your friends might have enjoyed a different experience even better, had you suggested it. If you’ve ever experienced something like this, you have been in a situation where groupthink might be at play.==

==[Groupthink](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/groupthink)== ==is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a group prioritizes consensus and harmony over critical thinking and independent judgment.== In UX design, where collaboration is crucial, groupthink can stifle innovation, leading to suboptimal design choices that fail to meet user needs. ==To create truly user-centered designs, UX teams must be vigilant against groupthink and actively foster an environment that encourages diverse perspectives and independent thinking.==

Social psychologist Irving Janis introduced Groupthink first in 1972. Janis defined ==groupthink as a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive group, where the desire for unanimity overrides their motivation to appraise alternative courses of action critically.==

## Avoiding the Trap: Strategies and Real-World Examples

==To combat groupthink, UX teams must create a culture that values critical thinking, diverse perspectives, and constructive dissent.==

**1. Encourage Open Dialogue**

**Tactic:** Foster an environment where every team member [feels comfortable expressing their opinions](https://hbr.org/2019/04/make-your-meetings-a-safe-space-for-honest-conversation), even if they differ from the majority view. Leaders should model this behavior by actively seeking out alternative viewpoints and encouraging team members to challenge ideas constructively. [Meetings](https://medium.com/capitalonedesign/designing-team-meetings-so-they-dont-suck-3b4059eda165), though already plentiful, are an important mechanism for gathering your team and encouraging dialogue.

**2. Assign a Devil’s Advocate**

**Tactic:** ==Deliberately assign someone to play the role of the== ==[devil’s advocate](https://www.inc.com/bruce-eckfeldt/how-to-play-devils-advocate-in-a-productive-way.html during discussions. This person’s job is to question assumptions, challenge popular ideas, and present alternative solutions, regardless of their personal beliefs. The devil’s advocate should approach the discussion with a critical mindset, seeking to identify potential flaws, weaknesses, or oversights in the proposed plans or ideas.==

**3. Diverse Teams and Cross-Functional Collaboration**

**Tactic:** ==Involve team members from different disciplines (e.g., design, research, development, marketing) in the design process to ensure that multiple perspectives are considered.== ==[Cross-functional collaboration](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/building-a-successful-ux-process-with-cross-functional-teams-fb03278a1a51) encourages the questioning of assumptions and helps surface potential issues that might be overlooked by a more homogenous group.==

**4. Anonymous Feedback Mechanisms**

**Tactic:** ==Implement== ==[anonymous feedback tools](https://medium.com/@Teamflect/a-short-guide-to-anonymous-employee-feedback-1a65caf4b5be)== ==to gather honest opinions from team members without the influence of group dynamics. This can be particularly effective in the early stages of brainstorming or during design critiques, where team members might otherwise feel pressured to conform to the majority view.==
