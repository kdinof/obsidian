# Description
---
> In product design, like in business in general, success isn’t just about achieving that milestone next month, and then the next milestone the month after that. It’s about realizing a collective vision and making sure those milestones contribute to it. A team vision serves as a North Star a team can refer to in times of ambiguity and/or uncertainty in order to ensure everyone is working towards the same ultimate goal(s), based on a shared purpose and values. 

> For starters, it helps ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction (that’s why visions are also sometimes called “North Stars,” which provide a global direction to move towards).
> A vision acts as a kind of “glue” ([Zasa & Buganza](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBS-04-2022-0065/full/html), 2023). When everyone in the team understands the ultimate objective, they can better prioritize their tasks and make decisions that support the larger goal.
