### [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Cognitive Load]]
We use our devises in unpredictable and stressful way
- Easy to make a decision for users
	- Social proof
	- Rating
- Reduces amount of effort / number of actions (not all of the information on the one pageâ€”simplify to steps) [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Perceived Effort]]

Example of degree of cognitive load across some stressful situation. In this example research shown that experiencing delay on your mobile phone is more stressful than watching a horror movie

### Processing fluency
Content that is easy to process (high in cognitive fluency) is usually perceived as more trustworthy than that which is less

**Repetition**
When we see or hear a statement repeatedly, we tend to rate is as more likely to be true (regardless of whether we remember having seen it before)
Repetitive actions can be more memorable 

**Structure**
Familiar = easy to process. Example of NIKE branding (font, 3 words, full stop.)

**Simple language**

### Hedonistic adaptation

Over time, we become de sensitized / bored of the same thing (feature, concept, rewards)
Example: spikes of engagement after launching a new version of Angry birds game.
