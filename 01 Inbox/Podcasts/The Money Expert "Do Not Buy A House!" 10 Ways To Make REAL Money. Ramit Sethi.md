## Key Takeaways from the Podcast:
---

**1. Define your "Rich Life":**
Most people haven't clearly defined what their ideal life looks like. This lack of clarity can make it difficult to make intentional financial decisions. **By taking the time to define your desires and values, you can set achievable financial goals that will help you create your "rich life."**

**2. Address Spending Habits:**
Many people struggle with spending, not earning. This means that even if they make a good income, they might not be able to achieve their financial goals because they are not spending their money wisely. **If you want to improve your financial situation, it is important to address your spending habits. There are many resources available to help you learn how to budget, save, and spend your money wisely.**

**3. Income Doesn't Define Rich Life:**
Having a high income does not guarantee a rich life. A rich life is about more than just money. It's about having the time and freedom to do the things you love with the people you love. By making smart financial choices, you can achieve financial freedom and start living the life you've always dreamed of.

**4. Understanding Key Numbers:**
There are four key numbers that you should track: your fixed costs, your savings rate, your investment rate, and your guilt-free spending rate. By tracking these numbers, you can get a clear picture of your financial situation and make informed decisions about how to allocate your resources.

**5. Four Key Numbers to Track:**

The four key numbers to track are:

- Fixed costs: 50-60% of your take-home pay
- Savings: 5-10% of your take-home pay
- Investments: 5-10% of your take-home pay
- Guilt-free spending: 20-35% of your take-home pay

These are just general guidelines, and you may need to adjust them based on your individual circumstances.

**6. Design Your Rich Life:**
Your rich life is not going to happen by accident. You need to take the time to figure out what is important to you and how you want to spend your money. Once you know what you want, you can start to make financial decisions that will help you achieve your goals.

**7. Work with Respectful People:**
The people you work with can have a big impact on your life. If you work with people you respect and like, your work life will be more enjoyable and fulfilling. It is also important to surround yourself with positive people who will support you in your goals.

**8. Reconsider Buying a House:**
Buying a house is not always the best financial decision. There are many other ways to invest your money that will provide you with a better return. If you are considering buying a house, it is important to do your research and make sure that it is the right decision for you.

**9. Start Investing Early:**
The sooner you start investing, the more time your money has to grow. There are many different investment options available, so you can find one that is right for you. Even if you can only invest a small amount of money each month, it will add up over time.

**10. Action is Key:**
The most important thing is to take action. All of the knowledge in the world won't help you if you don't put it into practice. So what are you waiting for? Start taking steps towards your rich life today!
