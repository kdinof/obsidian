# Question
How do you understand that you’ve reached a certain grade or level in your career, such as transitioning to a senior role? 
Do you rely solely on performance reviews, or are there other ways you evaluate your growth? And what if there’s no formal performance review process? 

I’m asking because I often get questions about assessing one’s grade or level. 

So, I’m curious — do you have a similar need or interest in this topic?
Let me know your thoughts!

# My answer
I always see a hidden question here: "For what?" or "Why?" Why do I need to understand my level? Here are some interesting answers:

— "I want to be paid more": Performance review is the best way to assess your level, as this process is centralized across the company and deeply integrated with finance and C&B teams.

— "I want to know where I am in the global market" or "I want to start looking for new opportunities": In this case, you can ask mentors to evaluate your level or simply apply for vacancies at the level you think you've reached. Mentors and companies will give you valuable feedback.

— "I want to work on more complex and impactful projects": Your level doesn't matter here—just tell your manager you want more responsibilities and take action.

— "I want to grow professionally": Reflect on your work and get feedback from your teammates, managers, leads, or mentors. Develop your growth plan with your manager. This inevitably leads back to the first point in this list.

There could be more answers to the "why" question, and each answer has its own tools or combinations.

# What O1 thinks

**Why and with what I agree**  
1. **Asking “why” first**  
   I agree that understanding *why* someone wants to know their level is crucial. The underlying motivation—be it compensation, job hunting, or simply growing professionally—often determines *which* tools or feedback loops are most helpful.  

2. **Different purposes require different tools**  
   Your examples show that formal performance reviews might be the “best” process for compensation or promotion, while professional growth often benefits from mentorship, peer feedback, or project opportunities. It’s not a one-size-fits-all situation; it’s important to match the tool to the purpose.  

3. **Feedback from multiple sources**  
   Another point I agree with is that we shouldn’t rely on a single measure. Talking to mentors, colleagues, or even external recruiters can give a broader perspective on where you stand in the market and what your strengths or gaps might be.

**Why and with what I disagree**  
1. **“Your level doesn’t matter”**  
   While it’s true that you can simply request more responsibility if you want to work on complex projects, I disagree that “level doesn’t matter.” If you’re *too far* below the skill requirements, you might not succeed in those projects, causing frustration for you and your team. Conversely, if you’re overqualified, you might not feel challenged enough. So, knowing your level—even if it’s informal—helps ensure a better alignment of responsibilities and capabilities.  

2. **Performance reviews as the singular best way for salary negotiation**  
   ==Performance reviews can be central for aligning with a company’s budget and pay structure, but they’re not the *only* (or always the best) way.== Designers who build strong personal brands, have a robust portfolio, or bring specialized skills can often negotiate effectively even outside formal performance cycles. Sometimes external validation (e.g., a competing job offer) can be more powerful leverage than a standard review.

**Challenging your questions by asking my own**  
1. **Short-term vs. long-term goals**  
   - ==“How do you differentiate between short-term goals (e.g., a pay bump) and longer-term career milestones (e.g., mastery of a domain, leadership opportunities) when you assess your level?”==  

2. **Contextual understanding**  
   - “What if your organization doesn’t have a formal review process—how do you build a personal development plan and track progress with limited structural support?”  

3. **Role vs. growth**  
   - “How do you handle a situation where the next official ‘role level’ doesn’t align with the type of challenges you want to take on? Do you push for an official promotion first, or do you advocate for bigger responsibilities even if the title or compensation remains the same in the short term?”  

4. **Comparing external benchmarks**  
   - ==“How important do you think it is to benchmark yourself against industry standards versus focusing on internal evaluations from your current organization?”==  

5. **Company culture & values**  
   - “How do you see different company cultures shaping the approach to recognizing levels? In some organizations, formal levels are everything; in others, titles barely exist—how would you adapt?”

**In sum**, I agree that you need to start with the question *why*—it dictates the right tool for measuring “level.” I do see a nuanced need for understanding one’s level to ensure proper alignment between capabilities, challenges, and career growth. And finally, I encourage more open-ended discussions about goals, contextual factors, and industry benchmarks to ensure you’re not just chasing a title but rather aligning your career trajectory with what truly motivates you.
