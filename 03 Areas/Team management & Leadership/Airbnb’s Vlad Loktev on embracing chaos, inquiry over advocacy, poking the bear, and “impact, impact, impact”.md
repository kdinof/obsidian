# Description

**Some takeaways:**

1. Relentlessly focus on impact. Start by identifying the highest priorities for your organization or team. ==Each day, ask yourself: _What are the most critical tasks or projects that align with these priorities?_ Ensure your efforts are directly contributing to these goals.==
    
2. ==Don’t be afraid to “poke the bear”:== When you have a strong opinion or concern, don’t shy away from voicing it, even if it challenges the status quo. Poking the bear means confronting difficult issues constructively and openly, which can drive meaningful change and improvements.
    
3. Lead with curiosity and dial down advocacy: When entering a conversation or meeting, start by asking open-ended questions to understand others’ perspectives fully. This approach shows respect for differing opinions and helps you gather important information. Only after you have actively listened and absorbed the other viewpoints should you advocate for your own perspective.
    
4. ==Let some fires burn. You can’t address everything at once, and if you feel a need to do so, that’s a sign you don’t understand what’s most important for your business.== You need to be explicit with yourself and your team about what the priorities are and what you’re willing to let burn in service of them. Aligning on this in advance will help you resist the urge to put out fires as they start.
    
5. Two tools to help you calm your mind:
    1. The serenity prayer: “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Use the prayer to focus on what is within your control and let go of what isn’t.
    2. The shit bucket: Designate a specific place, like a physical trash can or a digital file, as your ‘shit bucket’ for frustrations and issues you can’t change. When you encounter a challenge or setback, write it down and place it in the shit bucket. Once it’s in the bucket, commit to not dwelling on it.
6. ==Ensure that your core values are not just documented but actively integrated into every aspect of the organization.== This includes hiring, performance reviews, promotions, and everyday interactions. Provide clear, actionable examples of what each core value looks like in practice, and recognize and celebrate employees who exemplify these values.
