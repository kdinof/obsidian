I'm looking for research and studies on how the level of English language as a foreign language can be increased from intermediate to advanced in less than 3 months. 
Focus on recent research and studies that involve AI products like LLMs, Voice-to-text, and text-to-voice in the study process. 
As a result I want to get a detailed plan, sources, and suggestions. 

I'm researching ways to accelerate English language learning from an intermediate to advanced level within a three-month period. I am particularly interested in recent (last 5 years) empirical studies and methodologies that utilize AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), voice-to-text, and text-to-voice tools to enhance language acquisition. 

Please provide:
- A comprehensive, step-by-step plan that outlines daily or weekly learning strategies.
- An analysis of key methodologies supported by recent research.
- A curated list of credible sources and studies, including case studies where available.
- Practical suggestions for integrating AI tools into the language learning process.

The goal is to develop a detailed, actionable roadmap that leverages modern AI-driven approaches for rapid language proficiency improvement.
