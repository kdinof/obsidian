We’re excited to announce the Agents Intensive Capstone Project (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/agents-intensive-capstone-project), as the final step of the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google, which concludes today.

This capstone project gives you the opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills gained from the course to a real-world use case on Kaggle. Over the next two weeks, you’ll demonstrate at least three key concepts that you’ve learned during the course using Agent Development Kit (ADK). 

Participation in the capstone project is optional. All participants will receive a Kaggle badge and certificate by the end of December 2025.
