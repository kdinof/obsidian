I want to build a Telegram bot that will transcribe my voice messages to text and structure this text using LLM like open AI 

Steps
1. I will record voice notes and send them to this Telegram bot.
2. voice notes could be in Russian or English languages. 
3. The voice message should be transcribed to text using elevenlab API
4. After transcribing, the text should be well-structured using AI, for example, the OpenAI API using the prompt 
5. Lastly this structured should be sent back to me from the bot.


Overall, the process is: 
1. I record my voice notes.
2. The bot responds with the structured text version of my voice notes.

How can I build this bot, what stack should I use, and what is the step-by-step process for building this bot?
