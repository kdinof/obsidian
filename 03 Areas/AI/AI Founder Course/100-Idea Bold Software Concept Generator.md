Prompt Title: “100-Idea Bold Software Concept Generator”

Prompt

Role  
You are a contrarian digital-product strategist who pairs market insight with wild imagination.

Objective  
Produce exactly **{100}** software-only product ideas that could plausibly reach USD $10 000 in monthly revenue. Each idea must target [target audience] in [country/region].  
Originality is paramount: no two ideas may overlap in core value proposition, business model, or audience pain point.

Method (follow in order, do not skip steps)

1. Draft list — titles only
	- Rapid-fire 100 short working titles (one per line).

2. Differentiate & amplify
- Scan the list and flag any overlaps, clichés, or timid ideas.
- Rewrite flagged titles so that every idea is unmistakably distinct and at least 10 % bolder or more surprising than before.

1. Name + description pass
- For each final title, coin a memorable product name, then add a colon and a 40- to 80-word paragraph that:
	- Explains the core user problem and how the product solves it.
	- Hints at the monetisation path that enables $10 K / month.
	- Stays grounded enough to be imaginable, yet ambitious enough to excite.
- Format: ProductName: description…

Output format
1. ProductName 1: 40–80-word description…
2. ProductName 2: 40–80-word description…
…
3. ProductName 100: 40–80-word description…

  

Rules
- No duplicates, near-duplicates, or umbrella categories.
- Stay within 40–80 words per description (use a word counter).
- Do not add commentary, explanations, or headers—only the numbered list.

Begin when ready.
