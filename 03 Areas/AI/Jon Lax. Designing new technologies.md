# Description
---

Here's a summary of the key topics from Jon Lax's podcast interview:

**Career Journey & Evolution**
- Three distinct chapters paralleling internet evolution: Web 1.0 era, Web 2.0 era, and Meta/Reality Labs
- Led AR/VR design at Meta (2018-2023) before taking a career break

**AI & Technology Development**
- Discusses pre-product AI development at Meta and challenges with research vs. product teams
- AI researchers focused on tech capabilities while lacking product focus
- Emphasizes importance of starting small with new technologies rather than attempting complete solutions

**Design Leadership Insights**
- ==Advocates for reducing scope and surface area when working with new technologies==
- ==Argues against over-staffing design teams too early for emerging technologies==
- Questions the industry's focus on craft over utility and basic functionality

**Career Development & Adaptation**
- ==Emphasizes importance of being adaptable and following value rather than rigid career plans==
- ==Suggests building "bridges" to learn new technologies through familiar concepts==
- Discusses productivity gains from AI tools while acknowledging potential job market impacts

**Design Tools & AI Integration**
- Views AI as productivity enhancer rather than replacement
- Predicts significant developments in company-specific internal AI tooling
- Emphasizes importance of fundamental design thinking over specific tools

The conversation particularly focused on how designers should approach emerging technologies and adapt their skills in an AI-driven future, while maintaining focus on creating useful products rather than pursuing perfect craft.

Based on Jon's advice, ==new designers entering the tech industry should stay flexible and avoid rigid career planning.== He recommends ==starting with consulting or agency work to gain diverse experience and exposure to different projects==. This helps identify areas where you can provide the most value.

==When it comes to skills, Jon emphasizes treating AI and other tools as additions to your toolkit rather than threats.== The focus should be on developing fundamental design thinking and problem-solving abilities, including learning how to deconstruct designs and understand core principles. He suggests building bridges between familiar concepts and new technologies by finding connections that help you learn.

==Jon encourages new designers to embrace being beginners and accept that their first job likely won't match what they learned in school.== The tech industry is constantly evolving, so stability shouldn't be expected. Instead of obsessing over design inconsistencies or following predetermined career paths, focus on creating utility and value. Academic training may not fully align with industry needs, so be prepared to adapt and learn new tools as required.

The key is to maintain flexibility and stay focused on where you can provide value, rather than chasing trends or trying to follow a rigid career path. This approach allows designers to grow and adapt as technology and industry needs evolve.

At the end of the podcast, Jon discussed two key developments he anticipates for design teams:

==First, he predicts the emergence of company-specific internal AI tools for designers, similar to how companies developed their own design systems.== ==Large companies will create proprietary AI tools that help with design work, but these developments won't be publicly visible since they'll exist within companies.==

Second, he expects some companies will attempt to use AI tools to enable PMs to handle design work independently. However, he predicts these efforts will fail, as similar attempts have historically been unsuccessful.

Jon emphasizes that designers need to adapt to this dynamic environment. He suggests that those seeking stability should consider working in mature industries like banking, while those in tech must embrace constant change and focus on finding ways to remain valuable as technology evolves.
