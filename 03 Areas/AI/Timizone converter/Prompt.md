I want to make a Web App that will convert one timezone to another timezone. 

Functuionality
- the app can know your local time and location
- the app can process converting from various user inputs like:
	- using city or country name (time in New York, Moscow time, Uzbekistan time, etc...)
	- using time zone abbreviations (PT, PST, KST, etc...)
	- combine time zone abbreviations and names (14:00 PT time in Uzbekistan)
	- time can be used 24 hours or 12 hours notations
	- in the result should be calculated time

UI
- The app should look like a text-only IDE-like design. Centered in web view have 500x500px dimensions. 
- the query should be typed like a code in IDE, and after clicking "return," the app should calculate results and show them on the same row but align right.
- also after clicking return user can write a next query in the next line
- I want my app to look like Numi.app https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnumi.app%2F&psig=AOvVaw1PzuixB2REvyPMxegFMn1h&ust=1744267068606000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBUQjRxqFwoTCPjl96mryowDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE
