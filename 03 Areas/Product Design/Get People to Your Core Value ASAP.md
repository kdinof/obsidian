## Entities

- **Vevo**: A music service that conducted user testing and analytics on their intro tour, discovering that most users skipped the tutorial.
- **Google Photos**: A Google product that streamlined its onboarding process by removing unnecessary steps and focusing on the critical action of turning on auto backup.
- **Jump, Spin, Ofo, Bird, Lime**: Scooter sharing companies used as examples in a competitive analysis to evaluate onboarding experiences.
- **Competitive Analysis**: A process where companies look at what other sites or apps are doing for specific features to inform their own design decisions.
- **User Testing**: A method used by Vevo and Google Photos to evaluate how users interact with their onboarding processes and make data-driven decisions.

## Short Summaries

- Competitive analysis often leads companies to adopt features like intro tours because others are doing it, but user testing can reveal that these features may not be effective.
- Vevo's user testing showed that most users skipped their intro tour, leading to an experiment that increased app engagement by removing the tutorial.
- Google Photos streamlined its onboarding process by eliminating unnecessary steps and focusing on the critical action of turning on auto backup, which improved user engagement.

## Arguments

### The Ineffectiveness of Intro Tours
- Many companies include intro tours in their onboarding process because competitors do, but user testing often shows that users skip these tours, rendering them ineffective.

### The Value of User Testing
- Vevo's user testing revealed that their intro tour was not being utilized, leading to a more effective onboarding process by removing it. This highlights the importance of testing features with real users.

### Streamlining Onboarding Processes
- Google Photos improved user engagement by removing unnecessary onboarding steps and focusing on the critical action of turning on auto backup, demonstrating the benefits of a streamlined process.

### The Pitfalls of Competitive Analysis
- Relying solely on competitive analysis can lead to the adoption of ineffective features. Companies should validate these features through user testing and analytics.

### ==Maximizing Product Value Quickly==
- ==The principle of getting users to product value as fast as possible, but not faster, is crucial. This means asking for the minimum information needed to provide a valuable experience, as demonstrated by Google Photos.==

## Summary
The text discusses the common practice of using competitive analysis in software design, where companies adopt features like intro tours because their competitors do. However, user testing can reveal that these features may not be effective. For instance, Vevo found that most users skipped their intro tour, leading to an experiment that increased app engagement by removing the tutorial. Similarly, Google Photos streamlined its onboarding process by eliminating unnecessary steps and focusing on the critical action of turning on auto backup, which improved user engagement. These examples highlight the importance of user testing and the pitfalls of relying solely on competitive analysis. The principle of getting users to product value as fast as possible, but not faster, is emphasized, demonstrating the need to ask for the minimum information required to provide a valuable user experience.

## Transcript

Once again... a splash screen, a few permission dialogues, and a tutorial, which is often justified by saying, everybody's doing it. But what does that mean?

Those of you that have worked at a software design company know it's pretty common to kick things off with what's known as a competitive analysis. That is, you look at what other sites or apps are doing for a specific feature, you print them out, put them on the walls, and compare what you see.

In the case of scooter sharing companies, we can look at the onboarding experiences of Jump, Spin, Ofo, Bird, Lime, and we see across most of them that there's an intro tour explaining the service to people. So the result of this competitive analysis is that intro tours are probably a good idea because everybody else has one, right?

But if you actually take the time to test some of these things, like the music service Vevo did, they looked at how people were using their intro tour through user testing and analytics. They found most people were just skipping through the tutorial without reading any of the copy.

So if they're skipping this, what would happen if they just got rid of the tour? Turns out in a 28-day experiment with over 160,000 participants, the total number of people who got into the app increased. Completing the tutorial didn't affect engagement or retention metrics, and more people actually completed sign-up.

You can see similar principles at work in the evolution of several Google products as well. Google Photos, for instance, used to have an intro tour, an animated tour, and an introduction to its Android app.

Following a series of tests, the team ended up with a much reduced experience. Away went the spinning logo, the get started screen, the animated tour, all which were sources of drop-off. 

All that was left was a redesigned version of the turn-on auto backup screen, which was overlaid on top of people's photo galleries. This step was critical to getting the value out of Google Photos. It's a service that backs up and makes your photos re-findable easily. Little in the app works without this step, so the team made it the first and only focus of onboarding.

It's a great illustration of the principle of **getting people to product value as fast as possible, but not faster.**

That is, ask the user for the minimum amount of information you need to get them the most valuable experience. In the case of Google Photos, that's turning on auto backup.
