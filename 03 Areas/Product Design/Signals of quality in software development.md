CJM buying a song was at the physical store more complicated than just download it. So what of we make it easier online. But what about music and quality of a streaming song? In this case speed = value.

## Copy & Paste Guiding principles

**Predictable**
User should get what they expect. In other words, before pasting, we should be able to ask a user "What will happen?" and their response (expectation) should match what will actually happen.
For instance, "I expect to get a clone of the component I copied before; a new component that looks exactly the same".
The fundamentals of copy, paste and duplicate should follow common implementations in e.g. operating systems. I.e. the "copy" action records the primary selection. 

**Helpful**
Paste should be helpful when it can, without detriment to predictablility. Paste should make good use of all the information contained within the pasteboard, like position data and component IDs.
Example: Copying a logo that's at the top right corner of one frame, and pasting it into a similar frame should insert the logo at the same position (top right corner.) Otherwise the user would have to perform tedious manual work to line up the position of the pasted logo within the second frame. 

**Visual symmetry**
Paste should yield ideally idential pixels on the screen as the object that was copied.
This connects to predictability in some ways: The user expects that paste produces identical results, based on experience with a myriad of other software.

**What quality means**
- Not being an incoherent mess of disconnected ideas and meaningless features
- Readability is a top concern
- The software getting out of my way
- Something that can fulfill its purpose without much distraction Reliability, performance, polish
- Easy to understand what is going on
- The closer a piece of software is to achieving a set of goals the more quality it has for that set

- It's the moment when the software gets to a state when unrelated things snap together, like if this was planned from the very beginning
- My test is some function of mental effort needed to maintain code
- Easy to modify and iterate Code should be adaptable and stand the test of time
- Software that works now and over time
- "Quality" is a fluid, subjective and context-dependent value that requires near-constant calibration
