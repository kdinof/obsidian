# Human Interface Principles

You can take advantage of people’s knowledge of the world around them by using metaphors to convey concepts and features of your application. ==Use metaphors involving concrete, familiar ideas and make the metaphors plain, so that users have a set of expectations to apply to computer environments.==

The desktop is the primary metaphor for the Macintosh interface

Metaphors in the computer interface suggest a use for something, but that use doesn’t define or limit the implementation of the metaphor.

**Direct manipulation** allows people to feel that they are directly controlling the objects represented by the computer.

In addition to expecting physical results from their actions, users want their tools to provide feedback.

Users want to see what actions are available at any given moment. If grave consequences might follow from any of those actions, they want to know about those consequences—before any damage is done and while they can still change their minds.

Animation, when used sparingly, is one of the best ways to show a user that a requested action is being carried out.

The Macintosh desktop works according to two fundamental paradigms. Both paradigms share two basic assumptions: that users can see on the screen what they’re doing and that users can point at what they see. The paradigms are based on a general form of user action: noun-then-verb. For example, a user clicks a document icon (the noun) and then prints (the verb) the document by choosing Print from the File menu.

**Consistency**
**Consistency in the interface allows people to transfer their knowledge and skills from one application to any other.**

Consistency in the visual interface helps people learn and then easily recognize the graphic language of the interface—for example, once users know what a checkbox looks like, they don’t have to learn another symbol for making choices.

People should be able to find all the available features in your application. If you find a need to initially “hide” features, do it in a way that gives people information about where they can find more choices

**User Control**
People learn best when they’re actively engaged.

**Provide feedback** as they do tasks and make that feedback as immediate as possible. (or both), that your application has received the user’s input and is operating on it.

You can encourage people to explore your application by building in forgiveness. Forgiveness means that actions on the computer are generally reversible.


Involve users throughout the design process and observe them working in their environment

For design decisions regarding features in your application, you need to weigh the costs, which are not all financial, against the potential benefits. Every time you add a feature to your application, think about the following factors:
- Your application gets larger.
- Your application gets slower.
- Your application’s human interface gets more complex.
- You spend time in development rather than refinement of existing features.
- Your application becomes more difficult to document.
- You increase the number of possible user errors.
- Every new feature can have an impact on an existing feature.

During the design process, you may discover problems with your product design. You can use the 80 percent solution to help determine how to solve those problems. The 80 percent solution means that your design meets the needs of at least 80 percent of your users.

 [[02 Projects/Behavior Course for Designers/Growth Design/Biases/Progressive Disclosure]] is one way to reduce the complexity of your designs. It allows you to present the most common choices to users while initially hiding more complex choices or additional information.
