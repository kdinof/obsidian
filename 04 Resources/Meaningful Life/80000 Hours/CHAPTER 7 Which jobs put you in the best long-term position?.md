This document, "80K_HOURS_final.pdf", contains a chapter specifically addressing your question: CHAPTER 7, titled "Which jobs put you in the best long-term position?". This chapter argues that the key to being in the best long-term position is building what they call "career capital".

Chapter 7 begins by noting that while society often celebrates young achievers, expert-level performance in established fields usually requires 10 to 30 years of focused practice. This highlights the importance of long-term career planning and development.

==The chapter defines "career capital" as anything that improves your ability to make a difference or secure a fulfilling career in the future.== They break this down into five key components:

1. ==**Skills and knowledge:** This includes what you learn, how useful it will be, and how quickly you can learn it. A job is best for learning when it challenges you to improve and provides ample feedback from mentors and colleagues.==
2. ==**Connections:** This refers to the network of relationships you build, which can provide opportunities and support throughout your career.==
3. ==**Credentials:** These are the formal qualifications and achievements that demonstrate your abilities and open doors to new opportunities, such as degrees or public demo projects.==
4. ==**Character:** This encompasses virtues like generosity, compassion, humility, integrity, honesty, good judgment, and respect for important norms. Working alongside people with good character is especially influential. These traits are crucial for trust, collaboration, and ethical decision-making.==
5. ==**Runway:** This refers to your financial savings, which determine how long you could comfortably live without income. Aiming for at least six months of runway is recommended for financial security, while 12-18 months provides more flexibility for major career changes.==

==The central piece of advice in Chapter 7 for gaining the best career capital is to "get good at something useful". This means developing abilities that are valued in the job market, making it easier to negotiate for a fulfilling job, and are needed to address the world's pressing problems.== Once you have valuable skills, you also need to learn how to effectively communicate those skills and build connections.

Chapter 7 provides concrete steps for gaining career capital, including:

- ==Asking yourself what next step would most accelerate you toward a particular long-term position.==
- Considering which options will most broadly boost your capabilities.
- ==Aiming to work at high-performance, rapidly growing organizations where you can learn quickly, meet ambitious people, and potentially get promoted.==
- Strategically pursuing graduate studies in subjects where you are likely to excel and that align with your longer-term goals. The chapter suggests weighing graduate options based on personal fit, learning potential, career prospects, and reward dynamic. Examples of potentially valuable areas of graduate study mentioned elsewhere include economics and applied quantitative subjects.
- ==Taking entry routes into policy careers, such as certain congressional staffer positions, joining a congressional campaign, or working in specific executive branch roles. These can help you learn about social issues, gain prestige, and open doors in policy and the social sector==. However, it's important to consider the specific job, mentorship, reputation, character of colleagues, policy agenda, and cultural fit.
- ==Doing jobs that build useful skills for working on pressing problems and also provide good backup options. Examples given include management, software engineering, data science, information security, knowledge of China or other emerging economies, and marketing==. Data science bootcamps are mentioned as a potential option, particularly for science PhDs. Developing expertise in China is highlighted as potentially very impactful due to China's growing global influence.
- Taking opportunities that allow you to achieve something impressive, such as founding an organization or reaching the top of a field. Significant positive impact within the next five years can also be a great choice, as it builds relevant connections and skills.

==The chapter also discusses the trade-off between transferable and specialist career capital. Transferable capital is useful in many different options (e.g., social skills, management), while specialist capital is specific to a narrow range of paths (e.g., knowledge of malaria).==

==Importantly, Chapter 7 emphasizes that you can build career capital in any job by using your time effectively. Appendix 2 provides more details on how to do this, including advice on building character, networking, saving money, and becoming more generally effective.==

In conclusion, Chapter 7 of "80K_HOURS_final.pdf" suggests that the jobs putting you in the best long-term position are those that allow you to build significant career capital across skills and knowledge, connections, credentials, character, and runway. This often involves getting good at something useful, seeking out high-performance environments, strategically pursuing further education or policy roles, and developing in-demand skills while also focusing on achieving impressive accomplishments.

As a next step, you might find it helpful to review the "Five components of career capital" section in Chapter 7 (starting on page 106) in more detail to consider which of these components you might want to prioritize in your own career planning. Would you like me to guide you to that specific section or perhaps ask you some questions about which components of career capital you currently possess?
