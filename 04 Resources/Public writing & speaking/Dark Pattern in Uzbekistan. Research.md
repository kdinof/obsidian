How can we balance business needs with protection of user interests?

ASCI Academy partnered with Parallel, a product design studio  in Bengaluru, to start an initiative with the following objective:
To assess prevalence and use of Deceptive Patterns  in top Indian apps, encouraging the use of conscious designs, and promoting a shift towards ethically conscious online interfaces.
The research involved analysing the core user flows of over 50 apps, examining each screen for Deceptive Patterns across industries.

## Data Collection
a. App Selection
The process of selecting apps to study involved reviewing the number of downloads on the Playstore in order to shortlist the top B2C apps across categories. The final shortlist included 53 top downloaded apps (potentially not exhaustive) across nine categories.

b. App Analysis
To capture a new user’s experience, each app was downloaded on a new Android device. Android being the most widely used operating system in India was the focus of the study. Researchers then performed a series of key tasks across all categories, includings

Screenshots were taken to document the user flow for each app as of April - May 2024, the period during which the analysis was conducted.
