[[Is Everything BS? - by Rory Sutherland]]


Have you ever faced ideas that sound absurd and not rational to you, but after they have been developed, they start to sound more logical? Some rational storytelling appeared around this idea, and we feel like, "Woah, why haven't I done it before?"

Let me share a couple of examples here:

Imagine if I offered you to buy two dishwashers, not one. And you more likely will think that I'm an idiot who tries to sell you something just to make some money. But actually, two dishwashers can save some storage space in houses with small kitchens. When clean dishes are stored in the first dishwasher, you can store dirty dishes in the second one. And after the second one is full of dirty dishes you can start cleaning and store dirty dishes in the first dishwasher. 

Now, have your thoughts like: "Woah, why haven't I done it before?"

Or another example. Imagine if I ask you to boil 1 liter of water just using two candles and matches. For a lot of people, it seems impossible. There won't be enough heat from two candles. But when somebody tells you that the temperature of boiling depends on atmospheric pressure, if you get higher, the boiling temperature decreases. For example on the top of the mount of Everest water boils at 70 celsius. 

We only have rational and right ideas in our minds when we have to deal with problem or generate solutions for an idea, just because our brain work in this way. But the pool of the amount these "right" and "rational" is very less than a pool with all ideas and potential solution for a problem. Moreover ideas that seem irrational for us could be rational for somebody else. 

That is why we have to look on the problems from different angles, perspectives and considering various context. Ofter there is the multiple growth points and that amazing feelings, "Oh, was that even possible?"

Have you ever found that ideas which seem absurd at first only make sense once they're actually put into practice? It's like everything falls into place, and we're left wondering, "Oh, you could actually do that?"

Let's look at a couple of examples:

Imagine I suggested you buy two dishwashers. And you'd probably look at me like I'm an idiot just trying to make a sale and cash in. But in reality, two dishwashers can free up storage space in small apartments. One always holds the clean, dry dishes, while the other holds the dirty ones. Once the second one is full, you run it, and the first (now empty) machine is ready to start collecting dirty dishes again.

Well? Did that little thought flash through your mind: "Oh, that's kinda cool!"

Or imagine you need to boil water in a kettle using just two candles and a box of matches. At first glance, it seems impossible: two candles surely aren't enough to boil a whole kettle. Until someone points out that the boiling point of water depends on atmospheric pressure: the higher the altitude, the lower the boiling temperature. For example, on Mount Everest, water boils at just 70 degrees Celsius.

We mostly come up with ideas that seem 'right' and rational, simply because our brains are wired that way. But these "right" ideas are actually few and far between compared to the vast number of potential solutions that lie outside the box. What's more, ideas that seem irrational to us might be perfectly rational for someone else.

That's precisely why it's so important to look at tasks and problems from different perspectives, from various angles, and considering diverse contexts. Often, this is exactly where the potential for rapid growth and those amazing "Oh, you could actually do that?" discoveries lies.

To cultivate this way of thinking, you need to communicate more, share ideas, stay curious, and be open to new things. Personally, I find these things really helpful:

Talking with product users — helps understand how people actually use your product, not just how you imagine they do.
Talking with colleagues from different departments — gives you the chance to see a task through the eyes of a marketer, a developer, or a sales manager.
Design thinking sessions and brainstorms — help break free from conventional thinking, literally "extracting" ideas from participants' subconscious minds and collaboratively reaching unconventional solutions.
Basic knowledge of user psychology — helps understand why people act the way they do.
