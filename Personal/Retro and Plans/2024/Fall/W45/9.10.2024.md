Bali isn't the best place to live for long because of the kids' entertainment. Here it is suitable for kids till school, and then they have to have friends, especially with hum they can speak about everything in their native language.

# **✨ What Went Well**

It was a day with some unexpected cases. While looking for a house, we met Ivy — Nastya's good friend who lives here. We were at her birthday party, so I can call her a good friend. She has a house that is perfect for us but very expensive, 300 million per year. Now, we are waiting for her to negotiate with her cousin and come back with an answer about the price. 

We started to log our expenses and budget. My goal is to still save money while we are in Bali and have here a lot of expenses. 

I had a run today, but running is hard because of wet climate
