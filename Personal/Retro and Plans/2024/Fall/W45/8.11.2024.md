Some interesting and controversial thoughts start to appear about Bali. I remember that we can have here problems with immigration if we don't start our own business. 
The idea is to teach business. Product Design or just design small classes.

# **✨ What Went Well**

I love howe we live as a family together. I feel how differently we start to treat each other. 




#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

I wanna rent a bike, but I worry that I won't use the bike frequently and it's better to continue renting a car 



# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:
- What about teaching business here in Bali? If I write a curriculum and don't teach, should I have a work KITAS?
