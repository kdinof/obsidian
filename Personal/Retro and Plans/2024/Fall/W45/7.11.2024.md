We have arrived in Bali. The trip was hard because we were sick. But now we are happy to be here, and I want to start enjoying and appreciate every moment here. 

Our routine life starts from the beginning, and we have to set up all the everyday things we already had in Tashkent. 

# **✨ What Went Well**

We agreed with Nastya that I'll be responsible for increasing income, and she'll be responsible for decreasing our expenses. So she has to find more cheaper places where we can buy groceries. 



#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

Nastya and I are sick. So these sinus problems are common in Tashkent, and I hope that here this problem will disappear. 




# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

Don't forget a task about finding my personal purpose in life. 
- **I have to find another one channel of income** 
- I have to set up my daily routine. Run / Crossfit
