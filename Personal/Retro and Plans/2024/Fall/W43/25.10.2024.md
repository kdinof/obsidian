# **✨ What Went Well**

It was a wonderful evening. I met Bolat and drank some beer with him, and I also managed to pop by to meet the CrossFit guys.
I don't know why, but I have a lot of friendly, warm feelings for Jenya. He is like my buddy. 


#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

I spent too much money just on drinking beer.
I am not happy with Slava's work quality. I have to check every design he makes. He considers himself as a senior designer, but in reality, he is just a middle product designer  

Time management. I haven't done some tasks from a calendar
