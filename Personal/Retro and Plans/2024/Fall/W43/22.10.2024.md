I still don't know what my purpose is in this life. What can I make for people? The design isn't a thing that I am passionate about. It's just my job. 
These thoughts appear frequently day by day. And I feel that Tashkent and Click are something temporary, like a buffer zone between two countries. I don't know what country is on the other side, but I hope it's not another country like Uzbekistan. 

# **✨ What Went Well**
- I found a great article about how to improve design skills in a team. https://substack.com/home/post/p-146868919
- I realized that if I continue working at Click, I have to invest in my team and make a plan and structure on how to improve my skills
- Olya has to quit.

Pay more attention to Slava. His projects are going very slowly.
