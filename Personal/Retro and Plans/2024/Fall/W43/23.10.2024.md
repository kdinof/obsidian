# **✨ What Went Well**
We will sell the Nastya's house. I hope so. If we sell it, we will be more confident in Bali because we will have savings. We can also buy a car and a scooter.

I realized I had to store and structure all the information for designers in infographics and text. It'll help me to grow designers, and it could be like an idea for posts and writings.

I very much love how Grammarly works.

I don't like and don't understand what Yura does or what he will do to improve the scale and grow the design at Click.
