# ✨ What Went Well

Weekly win: Nastys's house will be sold after one week, and we have received a deposit. This is cool because we will have confidence when we live in Bali. Now we have a security deposit, and I can quit my job, and we can live on our savings for a minimum of 6 months.
We can also buy a car or a bike if we realize we will live in Bali for a long time. 

#  ⛈️ What Didn't Go Well

I don't like how Slava works. He thinks that he is a senior designer, but in fact, he is just middle. He doesn't know the basics of design, like how typography works



# 💫 Actions

- [ ] I have to make a plan for a step-by-step guide on how to find the purpose of my life.
Start by reading all weekly retrospectives. 

# 🤔 Thoughts 

I still don't know what the purpose of my life is. What I am really passionate about. I have to do retro again and spend a couple of days working on it when we set up everything in Bali.

If I want to integrate fully into the Bali community and culture, I have to learn Indonesian. So I have one year to learn it.
