The week when we spent a lot of time trying to find a house. 

# ✨ What Went Well

This was our first week in Bali, and it was lovely. 
Overall, living in Bali has become more expensive than the year before. On the other hand, living in Tashkent has also become more expensive, and it's compatible with the prices of living in Bali.
