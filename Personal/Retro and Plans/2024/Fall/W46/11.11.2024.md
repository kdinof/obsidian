# **✨ What Went Well**

It would be nice to live here in Bali for the next two years. The main reasons are:
- Health. Everybody in our family became healthier than we were in Tashkent.
- English. This is the primary language here, and I have more practice. 

The time difference between Bali and Tashkent is perfect for me, so I can start later and finish work at the time when I usually come back home from work in Tashkent. 

We found another house in Global Village — a nice, renovated, tiny one for an affordable price. So now we have some options to choose. 


#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

We have a dinner very late. And we have to manage our dining schedule. But now it's hard because we have to cook every time because we don't have a fridge. 


# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

I will have to find work in Asia first, not Europe. 

I have to find a day when I can think more about my plans and focus.
