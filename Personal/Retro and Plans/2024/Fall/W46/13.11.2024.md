# **✨ What Went Well**

I started to use the Raindrop app to save links from the internet

I started to recognize Bali from a little wider angle — what the island can give for Roma. And it can provide one main thing that carries about — English speaking education and English as a second language. 


#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

I have to develop my focus skills. 
Whenever I start a complex and challenging task, I open social media or other links that aren't related to this task. And my attention shifts somewhere. 

I don't develop my professional skills, and it will be hard to find a new job. I have to boost my design skills by teaching my team. The primary source of knowledge is Apple's human interface guidelines and material design guides.
