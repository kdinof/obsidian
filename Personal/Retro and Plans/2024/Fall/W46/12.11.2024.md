# **‚ú® What Went Well**

The main goal now is to find a house for long-term rent. Today, we have a couple of new options. And tomorrow we will visit them. 

I love working remotely because it is more convenient for me. I don't have to waste time getting from home to work. In Tashkent, it typically takes about 40-50 min. I also don't waste time on unuseful chats with colleagues. 


#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**

I didn't do any sports activities because we had busy mornings, and I still needed to manage my daily schedule.

Nastya scratched our car today. It wasn't Nastya. It was another driver, and he didn't see her. So she isn't guilty, but we will have to tell about it to Made. 


# **üí´ What Can Be Improved**:

I don't have to forget that I signed only a 4-month contract working remotely, so I have to find new work during this time. 

Managing money daily with Nastya.
