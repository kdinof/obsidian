I realized that I don't want to come back to Skyeng because it will be like following the wrong path, the path where I was and which I declined some time ago. 
I want to try to get work from International companies; that's why I started my portfolio and my small projects like pixel-snaps

# **‚ú® What Went Well**

It was Friday. 
I like how Vlad works on the Business's main web page. It's looking good. 



#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**


# **üí´ What Can Be Improved**:
How I manage time and plan a day. 
- Plan my day in Calendar + some small tasks in To-do.
- Write everything on a notepad

Choose projects I have to focus on:
- Personal portfolio website
- Go Practice course
