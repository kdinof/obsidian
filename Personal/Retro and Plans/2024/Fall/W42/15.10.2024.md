Starting today, I'll try to write my retros in English just for practice. 
I will keep this challenge until New Year and hope my English level will improve. 

# **‚ú® What Went Well**

I had a call with Kirill from Skyeng, and it was friendly and cosy. It felt like I was still at Skyeng. Everything was so familiar and common. 
But is this path that I want to follow? Will I get back to the point where I was one year ago? I don't know. 
I am sure that people at Skyeng are more skilled than people at Click and a product culture more mature. If I want to become a product manager, this is the best place where I can get experience and knowledge from experienced and skilled people. But if I want to get a job not in Russia this won't be the right choice.



#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**

It seems like the CPO at Click doesn't have control over what a product team wants to ship. Every product manages is doing some projects, but they don't fit into one clear picture of product vision
