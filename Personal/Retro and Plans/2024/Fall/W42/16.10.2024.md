# **✨ What Went Well**
It was a nice and fun day

I had a great talk with Kirill from Skyeng. At Skyeng, everything is excellent and stable, but this is the place I left one year ago, and at that time, I had a strong opinion on why I didn't want to work there. 
So now I have the same feelings about Click. And what would it be like if I came back to Skyeng? Escape from Click or natural desire to come back to Skyeng?



#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

I don't like how tasks appear and how they get into our team. Everything needs to be more organized and structured. Projects appear, and the project manager doesn't know how we will test it or how valuable this project is for our company.

No one believes in strategy and what we are doing now.
