Today was my first experience giving a talk at a conference. Everything was OK, not so bad as it could be :) I enjoyed the talk and the questions that were asked of me.
However, I noticed a couple of improvements that I have to make when I am preparing the next presentation:
- Understand what value and what knowledge I want to give to an audience. 
- Make more eye contact with the public. 
- Involve the public more by asking questions.
