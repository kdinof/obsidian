# ✨ What Went Well
It was a wonderful week because I did some important things:
- We bought the tickets to Bali. 
- I gave a talk at a conference. 




#  ⛈️ What Didn't Go Well

Chaos in the team. We don't know or believe in what we are doing now. What will the company and users get after we launch this feature? It's hard to understand and accept it. 


# 💫 Actions

Improvements for future public speaking:
- Understand what value and what knowledge I want to give to an audience. In this talk, I didn't give some actions or new knowledge. 
- Make more eye contact with the public.
- Involve the public more by asking questions.

Plan my time and focus.
- I don't know what my focus is for a week, so it's hard to plan the todos that I have to complete.
