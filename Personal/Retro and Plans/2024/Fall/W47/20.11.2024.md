# **✨ What Went Well**

We made insurance for me and Nastya. It was easy. So starting from Dec 4th, we will have our insurance card. 

Sometimes, I thought my team needed to improve, and I had to hire new designers. I have to keep my attention on Slava and give him a significant project that he will do. I also have to tell Yura about the problem that I see. 



#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**
We are still sick. I don't know what is with my throat, but it feels itching or tickling. I think this is only one problem that is not going well. 

Time for LKP: 1-2 hours



# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

I have to have 1-2 hours per week when I create tasks and write a description in Jira.
I can create tasks with only a header whenever I have a new task. 

Review my life goals.
