I don't do sport and sometimes feel guilty, but I understand it is just for a week or two, and I must accept it. 

I got a new portion of the video and a book about the mid-age crisis. I'm so curious to read it. 

I have to structure things that I have to do step by step. There are some necessary things that I still need to realize. 
- I have totally to focus on moving into the new house. For now, this is the main thing that we must do. After we start living in the new house I can focus and manage my schedule: CrossFit, work, side projects, surfing
- The next big thing I have to do is find a new job and realize what I want to do. For it, I have only four months.
