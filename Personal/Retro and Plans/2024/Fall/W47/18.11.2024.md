A lot of questions appear in my head about why we are here and whether we are ready to spend so much money on just living here. 
I don't want to go back to Tashkent because of the people, ecology, and education of Roma. I believe that education here is better and cheaper.

I finished the logo for Click Business. But making logos is not something that I really enjoy to do and what I'm skilled about. 



#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**

All morning, we coursed with Nastya because of morning time and who will get Roma to the kindergarten. I think that it's okay because now is a new period for us when we trying to live together without others help. 

I don't know what to do:
- To improve my sallary and have side projects 
- To start loking for a new job. 

Now it's like something unsolvable and complex
