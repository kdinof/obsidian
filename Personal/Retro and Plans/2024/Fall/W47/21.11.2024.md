# **✨ What Went Well**

We had perfect news for us today: we can move into Eddy's house starting from the 27th of November. So this is the next week! 


#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**




# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

I feel that I do not have a good enough salary, and my salary hasn't increased for almost 2 years. And by working at Click, I cannot increase it shortly.

I figured out I should have regular days a week when I dive into Figma and designs and create Jira tasks. 
I decided that Thursday will be Jira day 
Wednesday and Friday will be Figma days.
