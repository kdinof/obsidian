# ‚ú® What Went Well

I started to read the book about the mid-age crisis because sometimes I feel that I have lost the meaning of life. Sometimes, the way we are living our life with my family and how we make decisions seem unguided and spontaneous. Anyway, I appreciate and love Nastya because she chose to go with me on this life journey. And it's very valuable for me. 

The next week, we will move to the new house. We are waiting for this because we can't rest and live here in Plagoo. And the moving to the new house followed by a lot of spendings. 
Well, this week we bought 2 beds, 2 mattresses and a lot of stuff for the kitchen. I think that we have already spent about 15mil

I know that I can spend less time on work and more time doing things that really matter to me. Here are some of them:
- Finalize my personal website.
- Apply to hire-hire form
- Develop my English
- Make a behavior guide based on the A/B test
- Complete GoPractice.
