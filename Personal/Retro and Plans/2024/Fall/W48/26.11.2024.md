# **✨ What Went Well**

I realized that working at Click allows me to spend less time on work and more on something I want to do. 

People in Bali are very different from people in Tashkent. They sincerely want to help you. They are honest. 

I started to change my mind that we are here for a long time, not for one year because there is no place better than Bali now.


#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

The Air Quality here is so bad. It is worse than in Tashkent now. I hope that it is because of a volcano eruption. 



# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

Somehow, I have to expand my English vocabulary because sometimes it seems that I forget or don't know some words.
