# **✨ What Went Well**

I completed and published the last work case on my website. I have to just make polish and add Korzinka and Meditopia case studies. 

Today, I focused deeply on design processes and the Kinopoisk case study. The key elements to dive into focus are:
- understanding the goal
- not dig into details early; that is why the draft is also a good goal
- listen to music
- close all apps

#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

My back is hurt because of sitting all day on a chair. Therefore I have to buy a comfortable office chair for the new house.
