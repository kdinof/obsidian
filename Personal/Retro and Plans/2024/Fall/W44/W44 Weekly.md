# ‚ú® What Went Well

The trip to the Samarkand Marathon was incredible. We all have a lot of positive emotions. And that is necessary to have a chance to travel with a family. 

This is the last week we are in Tashkent, and I have some expectations about our trip to Bali. 
I don't know why we are doing it, why we are changing our comfort zone and starting everything from scratch. 


#  ‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well

We are all sick. Nastya has a runny nose and Roma cough, and I do not feel 100% healthy. So, we all got sick right before our trip to Bali. We can't predict when we can get sick. That is why I have accepted this situation, and I hope we get well soon.

I still have feelings that I'm downgrading while working at Click. I have a lot of stupid and unprofessional dialogues with my coworkers, and I don't want to argue with them because I don't have the motivation and answer to the question: "Why have I done it?"
