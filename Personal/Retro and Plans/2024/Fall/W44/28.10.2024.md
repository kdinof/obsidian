I still have a lot of thoughts about moving back to Moscow. This is the simplest way to find a place to live comfortably. There I will have a stable and excellent work. I am sure that Roma will go to a good kindergarten. We can rely on healthcare there. But we can't rely on the future. Nobody knows what can happen there in the next 5 years. The war is still going on, and it is causing a lot of challenges in economic politics and education.
So, if we have an option to live somewhere, why do we still think about it?

# **‚ú® What Went Well**
- I like how stable we generate images for our landing page. 


#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**
- I still have feelings that I'm degrading at Click. Because I don't have a robust and inspiring team, working without metrics and it's okay, but for me it's not.
