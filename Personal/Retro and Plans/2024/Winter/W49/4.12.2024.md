# **✨ What Went Well**

We signed the agreement for the new house. It's made us happy because living in a house is much better than living here in Plagoo. So now we have to buy some stuff for the house. 

I practiced driving a motorbike because I suddenly had to drive from Nusa Dua to Kerobokan and the back. 

I will inevitably have to tell my team and manager that I won't come back to Uzbekistan in a year. I may come but only for a couple of weeks. 

I finished working on projects for my portfolio. So now it's ready to be send.
