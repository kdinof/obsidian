# **‚ú® What Went Well**

Moving to the new House. I hope that it will change the perspective of how we live. 


#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**

When I see someone with whom I used to work before achieve great results, I feel envy and sadness. I started to think about what I had done wrong and where I turned not in the right direction. 
And I always get two answers:
- Click‚Äîthe company where I can not build a product with an excellent quality.
- We are moving from one place to another. This has led me to change the way I think about the place where I work. 

Now, I hope that we settle down here in Bali and that I can focus on finding great opportunities for myself. I hope that I can invest time to develop myself. 

I have to continue my focuses:
- new job
- behavior course
- try to make a prototypes
