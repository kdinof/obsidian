# ✨ What Went Well

We moved to a new house! We spent a lot of money, and now we have to appreciate the time and experience of living here. 
I remember that last time when we were living in Bali, I loved the way how we lived in the house. 
And I hope that here in this house I'll settle down and focus on health and work. 

#  ⛈️ What Didn't Go Well

Every time when I see someone's success, I feel envy and sadness. I think this happens because 2 years ago I was the head of design in a known IT company in Russia. Now I'm design lead at Uzbek IT company. It seems like a downgrade. 

# 💫 Actions

- I have to force the finding a new job process because it left less than 4 months before I have to tell than I live here for more than a year. 
- Focus on daily time management 

- Try to make interaction prototypes. I think there a lot of fun to learn how to make them, but first behavioral posts and course.
