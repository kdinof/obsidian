Welcome to winter. Sunny and hot winter because now I'm in Bali. 

# **✨ What Went Well**



#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

I had the same feeling that I didn't know what I wanted to do. What is my life purpose?

I felt that the people with whom I worked at Yandex and Skyeng developed their skills and knowledge more and faster than I did because they had a skilled community around them.

But how can I make this community here in Bali? Is it possible? Is it easier than in Tashkent or Moscow? It is 100% harder but real. 

# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

Focus and time management.
