# **‚ú® What Went Well**

I found it interesting to make an interaction prototype for design. And maybe this is the thing that I love to do.
On the one hand, behavioral knowledge. On the other hand, bold knowledge of UX and an understanding of the business part of the business. 
I have to take 1-2 days to build prototypes in Framer, Play, or try to learn Swift.

All day, I worked on recreating the New Navigations case study. And I see how it has become more stylish and beautiful.

SWIFT is working. 

#  **‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well**

There was a meeting about the brand with some guy who wanted to change our font. After the call, I wrote a post where I pushed not to change it. And I'm sure that I did it in the right way because we have to be open in the team and tell what we think.



# **üí´ What Can Be Improved**:

What will be after 4 months? 
Will I come back to Uzbekistan? No
Will I continue work at Click? I don't know. But I have to be ready to find new opportunities. 

All important tasks are scheduled in Calendar.
