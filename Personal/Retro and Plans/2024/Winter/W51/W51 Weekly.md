# ‚ú® What Went Well

I started to dive into AI, I bought Claude for 1 month and it works amazing. I think that it works much better than Chat GPT but has limitations like not having a voice input, camera, screen, and voice recognition. 

I had a call with the Avito Team, but I realized that I don't want to work there. Avito has never been a place where I want to work and a product that I want to work on. 

#  ‚õàÔ∏è What Didn't Go Well

I got sick. I do not have a high body temperature, but the main symptom is pain when I swallow. It's almost 3 days I've been sick. I hope that I'll recover tomorrow. 

Sometimes, I still think, why are we here?  Why have we decided to move to Bali, paid an enormous amount of money just to live here? But is there some other options that fits our wishes and goals? I don't think so. And it's definitely not Tashkent. Maybe Moscow or Russia, but not Tashkent. 

I wanted to live in Krasnaya Polyana if we came back to russia, but then I realized that there were no good schools for Roma and Kindergarten for Sasha.
