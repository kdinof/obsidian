# **‚ú® What Went Well**

Today was the day I've been striving for. It started with going to the gym, and after I had a lot of time for doing my projects. 
For me, it's the best schedule. 

Continue to dive into AI with Vlad, and it seems a very interesting path. I think that in the future, every designer should master AI skills. 

I was happy to help my team with reviewing their work. I hope that it helps to grow the overall quality of my team. 

Sometimes I think that it's okay to work in Clicl because I have to create challenges on my own. Now I have:
- grow a team
- dive into AI
- redesign click business
