# **✨ What Went Well**

I had a call with the Avito team, and I have two feelings:
1. I never thought that Avito was the place where I wanted to work. And after a call, it still hasn't become one. 
2. I felt tired and unprepared for the following new job onboarding process because it was very energy-consuming and long. That's why I have to find a company and product that I am passionate about. 

At Click, everything started to be more explicit about the projects. So I definitely know that we will work on Platfom and Business part.

#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**

I got a little bit sick. I think that this is because of AC in the car
