# **✨ What Went Well**



#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**



# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:

I am totally sure that I have to fire Slava because he doesn't meet my expectations. The quality of his work is very low. 
- Ho doesn't pay attention to details and small improvements 
- It feels like he always hurries 
- He doesn't try to make quality every time better. 
For example today I looked at his Figma files, and again I saw a lot of small mistakes
