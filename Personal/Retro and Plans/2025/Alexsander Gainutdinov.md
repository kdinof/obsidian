April 20th is the day when the second child was born. The name of this child is Alexander. 
I'm so happy that everything went well. The delivery was without problems or accidents. It was one; Alexander was born with pneumonia in his lungs, but it was definitely manageable. The main disappointment here was that Alex had to spend 3 days in an intensive care room and received some antibiotics. 

My feelings
I'm happy! Really! I can't wait for a moment when I can hug Alex, kiss him, and walk with him. I can't wait for a moment when we finally come back home. I remembered Roma's childhood and all the interesting things that happened with us. It was such a lovely time.
