# Intro
### 1 win from the day
- I finished polishing my LinkedIn account. Now it looked ready to start finding a new job.
### 1 point of stress or anxiety
- Slava and his suggestion to continue having a rest 
### 1 point of gratitude
- Thanks to the neighbors who kept the delivery that had been sent to me, but mistakenly, a courier left it at their house.

# **✨ What Went Well**
- I liked how I focused on tasks. 
- I like the office where I work. 
- Finally, we started to use a Dehumidifier, and it worked. The air really started to be dryer. 
- I got an interview invitation from inDrive. 


#  **⛈️ What Didn't Go Well**
- I started to work very late, around 1:30 pm. It happened because Roma didn't go to kindergarten, which was like a family morning.

# **💫 What Can Be Improved**:
- Morning time management
